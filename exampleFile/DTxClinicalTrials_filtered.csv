Ten chronic shoulder pain patients (7 Female, 3 Male, mean age = 48.44 years) provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study. Eight patients presented with chronic pain of the left shoulder and two presented with right chronic shoulder pain. Patients were recruited from a local pain clinic. Patients were excluded if they reported a history of motion sickness, a history of seizures, or cognitive impairments. A total of twenty-one patients were assessed for eligibility. Two patients were excluded prior to participation for a history of vertigo or motion sickness, and one was excluded due to color blindness. Four patients declined to participate prior to beginning treatment. Four patients were excluded due to impending surgeries scheduled that would prevent them from completing the study protocol (see Figure 1 consort diagram).

Patients who volunteered to participate in the study were shipped an Oculus Quest six-degrees-of-freedom wireless head mounted VR display (HMD) and hand controllers. Patients were assigned a health coach to assist with the use of the VR hardware. The health coach met with the patients via a HIPAA compliant telehealth video chat platform. Patients were instructed on safe use of the VR headset and hand controllers and instructed on how to create the safe play guardian of the Oculus Quest VR system and how to connect the HMD to a home wi-fi. After the patients confirmed that they were comfortable using the Oculus Quest, they were advised to complete three sessions of functional rehabilitation in VR exercises per week over the course of eight weeks. All function rehabilitation exercises were self-administered by each patient. The coach conducted telehealth video chat sessions with each patient once per week and administered a structured curriculum that included pain neuroscience education, goal setting, instructions for pacing and grading, and flare-up management.

Functional rehabilitation exercises were delivered through KarunaHOME (Karuna Labs, Inc, San Francisco, CA). KarunaHOME is a virtual reality software delivered on the oculus quest to provide rehabilitation exercises in patient's homes. KarunaHOME Virtual Embodiment Training™ consists of five functional rehabilitation exercises designed on the principles of graded exposure and mirror therapy.

Each session of functional rehabilitation began with a calibration exercise that measured shoulder range of motion for flexion, scaption, and abduction (Figure 2). The calibration exercise progressed through shoulder flexion, shoulder scaption, and shoulder abduction one at a time, on each side. The patient was instructed in VR to perform three repetitions within a comfortable range. The calibration exercise was a measurement of a patient's comfortable range of motion for flexion, scaption, and abduction and was used to set the limits of subsequent exercises so that patient did not move beyond their comfortable range during that day's session. The second exercise was a functional movement exercise that promoted shoulder flexion, scaption, and abduction while engaged in a reach and grasp task. Patients reached for an orb in the form of a floating lotus flower positioned in front of the patient in the virtual environment. Patients grasped the orb by moving the hand controller, which corresponded to movement of the virtual avatar's arm, and then pulled the trigger of the Oculus Quest hand controller using the index finger to toss the orb into a pond by producing either an overhand or underhand throwing motion and releasing the trigger. The second exercise also incorporated a mirror visual feedback (MVF) manipulation where the avatar's contralateral limb moved relative to the patient's movement. For example, if the patient moved their right arm, they would see embodied avatar's left arm moving. MVF was used for half the duration of each exercise. The third exercise was a reach and grasp exercise where patients reached to grasp colorful flowers by moving the hand controller to position the virtual avatar's arm in front of their embodied virtual avatar. The goal of this exercise was to match flowers of the same color in sets of three or more. The patient reached up for a flower to remove it and then the flowers above will fall into place. The exercise required patients to reach a maximum height by continuing to remove flowers. The fourth exercise was a painting exercise designed to promote complex dynamic shoulder motion. The goal of this exercise was to connect numbered dots by using the hand controller to move the virtual avatar's arm in a dynamic pattern to recreate different shapes in the sky using a virtual paintbrush. The first few shapes were directly in front of the patient and were simple movements such as a circle, triangle, heart. The shapes became progressively more difficult, requiring greater shoulder range of motion for reaching above and to the side, and progressed to more complex shapes to connect. The final exercise was a simulated activity of daily living in the form of a bow and arrow experience. Movements were designed to mimic motions that are included in activities of daily living such as putting on a seatbelt or shampooing hair. There were three distinct exercises within the bow and arrow activity. In all exercises, the patient moved the hand controller to move the virtual avatar's upper extremity limbs in a position that was necessary to complete the task. The first exercise required patients to reach the affected arm across body (horizontal adduction) to the quiver on the opposite hip to grasp an arrow and then bring the arrow to the bow (shoulder flexion) and pull back (scapular retraction) and shoot towards a target. The second exercise required patients to reach with affected arm over and behind the opposite shoulder to the quiver to get an arrow and then bring the arrow to the bow (shoulder flexion) and pull back (scapular retraction) and shoot. The third exercise required patients to reach over the affected shoulder (shoulder flexion, abduction, and internal and external rotation). Each session progressed from the first exercise to the last exercise with one minute of a guided breathing exercise in between each exercise. Patients completed three sessions per week over the course of eight weeks.

Telehealth-based pain education and behavioral health coaching was administered once per week. The first session was ninety minutes in duration and consisted of a general introduction, a tutorial on safely using the VR hardware in the home, and general introductions to Virtual Embodiment Training. Sessions two through eight were sixty minutes in duration with each session addressing topics that could be applied in the virtual embodiment exercises as well as activities of daily living. Each session included discussions of goals to work towards, including goals within virtual embodiment exercises. Sessions also contained pain neuroscience education, instruction on graded exposure, and behavioral exercises designed to help patients cope with their chronic pain and manage stress with relaxation, awareness of emotions and pain-related thoughts, mindfulness and gratitude-based exercises.Patients were encouraged to apply what they learned in the behavioral coaching sessions in exercised performed in VR.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of a home-based functional rehabilitation program delivered in VR combined with telehealth-based education and coaching. The secondary objective was to determine appropriate outcome measures for an eventual larger scale randomized controlled trial. To assess the potential effectiveness of VR telehealth delivered functional rehabilitation, a battery of pain assessments were administered at three timepoints (pre, mid, and post), prior to beginning the eight week protocol, at the midpoint (week 4), and after completing the eight week protocol. The Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire was used to assess shoulder disability. The SF-36 was used to assess was administered to assess quality of life. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) was used to assess psychological aspects of pain. The Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) physical activity subscale was used to assess fear of movement due to chronic pain. The Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) was used to assess shoulder function. The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) was used to assess fear of movement. The Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) was used to assess patient confidence. The Yellow Flag Risk Form (YFRF) was used to assess chronic pain mechanisms. Since this was a feasibility study, additional measures were assessed to determine appropriate outcome measures for an eventual larger randomized controlled trial.",Yes,No,Device,"Chronic shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal pain condition that can have a profound impact on a sufferer's life and a large socioeconomic healthcare burden to society. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of delivering telemedicine enabled functional shoulder rehabilitation for chronic shoulder pain patients using immersive virtual reality. Ten chronic shoulder pain patients were recruited from local pain clinics. Patients engaged in three sessions of virtual embodiment training per week over the course of eight weeks. Rehabilitation sessions were delivered on an Oculus Quest head-mounted display and hand controllers. Rehabilitation exercises (virtual embodiment training) leverage techniques from graded motor imagery, such as visual mirror feedback and augmentation of the virtual avatar's movements. Eight pain assessments were administered prior to the first session, and at weeks four and eight to get an indication of the effect that telemedicine delivered virtual embodiment training has on symptoms of chronic shoulder pain.",Embodiment in Virtual Reality as a Telemedicine Digital Therapeutic for the Treatment of Chronic Shoulder Pain,,digital therapeutics intervention for chronic pain utilizing coaching and virtual reality application,telemedicine digital therapeutic,"""digital therapeutic"""

The negative consequences of untreated nightmares are significant and include impaired quality of life, sleep deprivation (often resulting in an increased intensity of nightmares), insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. Untreated nightmares can also exacerbate the symptoms of underlying psychological dysfunction in people with depression and anxiety, leading to poor occupational and or social functioning. Nightmares can be idiopathic or associated with the use (or withdrawal) of certain medications or substances or associated with disorders including PTSD.

NightWare (Minneapolis, MN) has developed a novel approach to the treatment of nightmares. Through the use of a smartwatch-based application that senses physiologic parameters, the participant is aroused from sleep (without awakening the participant) so that the nightmare is interrupted prior to reaching a threshold of severity in which the participant would awaken in distress. Seconds later the participant returns to sleep without having experienced a nightmare. This approach avoids risk from pharmacological treatment, avoids exacerbation of symptoms from image rehearsal therapy and allows for a simple method with easily achieved adherence compared to existing treatments.

The application has been effective in focus groups when used on both Apple smartwatches and Motorola smartwatches. For the purposes of this study, the investigators will be using only the Apple (Cupertino, CA) 3rd generation smartwatch and the Apple iPhone.

Diminished physical activity is highly prevalent in PD and often lead to the onset of disability. Regular, habitual exercise is a critical component of the long-term PD management. However, PD-specific motor (e.g. slow and diminished movements, variable step timing) and non-motor (e.g. depression, apathy) problems collectively hinder physical activity. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is a rehabilitation technique that employs the coupling of auditory cues with movement. When used during walking, RAS has been shown to benefit walking rhythmicity, quality, and speed. Therefore this rehabilitation technique can be advantageous in promoting moderate intensity walking activity. While clinical studies support RAS-based intervention, its translation to real-world, community-based environments and for long-term exercise for the promotion of physical activity is limited. The difference that determines viability of RAS for out-of-lab applications lie in the distinction between external entrainment (open-loop) versus autonomous entrainment (closed-loop). Open-loop RAS requires high levels of vigilance and is prone to error accumulation, which is problematic with gait dysfunction in PD. On the other hand, closed-loop RAS allows for natural and stable entrainment. A closed-loop approach in this case is a necessity of the task and a technological challenge to translate RAS to community-based settings. In this pilot, the investigators will utilize a breakthrough digital therapeutic that employs closed-loop RAS to alleviate PD-specific problems by regulating stepping patterns. Using music as a substrate for cue delivery, this digital therapeutic leverages gait benefits from RAS along with enjoyment of music listening, thus making it a viable and engaging modality that will yield habits of regular walking. The investigators posit that music that is linked to enjoyment serves as context cues that define the pre-condition to engaging in habitual walking exercise and increased physical activity. With repetition, these recurring contextual triggers (i.e. music) automatically evoke a habitual response of exercise, and thus has the potential to amplify physical activity.

The main aims of the study seek to examine if Amped-PD (Experimental Intervention) is more effective than a standard-of-care walking program (Active-Control Intervention) in improving physical activity based on moderate intensity walking (Aim 1), and in improving motor deficits related to quality of walking (Aim 2) in individuals with mild-to-moderate PD. Additionally, this study will examine whether habit formation mediates the relationship between the intervention (Amped-PD or Active-Control) and physical activity (Aim 3). The investigators hypothesize that Amped-PD will have greater improvements in amounts of moderate intensity walking and stride-to-stride variability based on stride length and swing time. Further, habit formation will be one mechanism that will explain the link between the intervention and physical activity. Secondary research aims will examine whether Amped-PD is more effective than Active-Control in improving motor and non-motor features based on short- and long-distance walking function, spatiotemporal measures of walking, step activity based on daily step counts, disease severity scores, quality of life, self-efficacy on walking, and depression.

This study will utilize the breakthrough digital music therapeutic developed and manufactured by MedRhythms (Portland, ME). To examine the effects of the intervention, the investigators will use clinical measures of motor and gait function, participant self-reports on habit formation, and quantified movement data on walking and physical activity using wearable sensors. This study will be implemented by carrying out the following study visits: (1) Primary screen over the phone, (2) Clinical Screening and Baseline Assessment, (3) Community-based, self-directed walking program (6 weeks), (3) Post-training Assessment; (4) Follow-up training (2 weeks), and (5) Final Follow-Up Assessment. Altogether, these procedures may take up to 10 weeks.",Yes,No,Device	Behavioral,"Regular, habitual exercise is a critical component of the long-term management of Parkinson disease (PD). However, PD-specific motor (e.g. slow and diminished movements, variable step timing) and non-motor (e.g. depression, apathy) problems collectively hinder physical activity. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is a rehabilitation technique that employs coupling of auditory cues with movement. Walking with RAS has been shown to benefit walking rhythmicity, quality, and speed. These walking benefits make RAS advantageous in promoting moderate intensity walking activity -- an important health-objective in the management of PD. However, the therapeutic potential of RAS in self-directed walking programs has not been examined. In this pilot, we will utilize a breakthrough digital therapeutic that delivers music-adaptive RAS to alleviate PD-specific problems by regulating stepping patterns. Using music as a substrate for cue delivery, this digital therapeutic leverages gait benefits from RAS along with enjoyment of music listening, thus making it a viable and engaging modality that will yield habits of regular walking. Habits are automatically recurring psychological dispositions that emerge from repeated behaviors. The investigators posit that music cues provide recurring contextual cues that automatically evoke habitual response of exercise, thus has the potential to prompt regular physical activity. This study will enroll 44 individuals with mild-to-moderate PD. The experimental intervention, ""Amped-PD"", is a 6-week, user-managed community-based walking program that utilizes music-adaptive RAS that progressively increases walking intensities.

The pathophysiological link between PTSD and CVD is complex and multi-factorial that likely involves premature vascular aging (i.e., large elastic arterial stiffening and vascular endothelial dysfunction) and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., reduced cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity [cBRS] and heart rate variability [HRV]), along with other mechanisms. Vascular aging and autonomic dysfunction are key antecedents in the development of CVD and individuals with PTSD have greater arterial stiffening, endothelial dysfunction and reductions in cBRS and HRV compared to those without PTSD. The mechanisms by which PTSD contributes to greater vascular and autonomic dysfunction are not completely understood. Sleep is important for cellular and tissue repair, free radical detoxification and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Sleep disturbance is a hallmark symptom of PTSD and is associated with biomarkers of vascular aging, autonomic dysfunction and increased risk of CVD. Nightmares, a central feature of PTSD associated-sleep disturbance, are a debilitating symptom that can lead to insomnia or sleep deprivation, daytime sleepiness or fatigue, mood disturbances, cognitive impairments, behavioral problems, or other sequela, that ultimately causes clinically significant distress and impairment in social, occupational and physiological function, as well as increased CVD risk. As such, therapeutic strategies and interventions aimed at reducing nightmare-associated sleep disturbances in individuals with PTSD are clinically important for improving sleep quality, cardiovascular health and risk for future age-associated CVD.

Various psychotherapeutic (e.g., imagery rehearsal therapy [IRT]) and pharmacological (e.g., prazosin) interventions are available for treatment of nightmares associated with PTSD. However, the evidence for their efficacy for addressing sleep disturbances is inconsistent, particularly with pharmaceuticals, and implementation barriers and poor adherence exist with psychotherapy. As such, novel alternative approaches, including the use of digital medicine such as app-based and digital platforms are being developed to improve treatment delivery. NightWare™ digital therapeutic system is one such novel platform that was recently granted Breakthrough Device designation by the FDA for the treatment of nightmares in adults with PTSD. NightWare uses a proprietary application on the Apple Watch® to collect biometric data (i.e., heart rate [HR] and body movement) to learn sleep patterns to create a stress Index. When an individual exceeds this index due to entering a nightmare, NightWare intervenes by sending vibrotactile feedback to the Apple Watch, arousing the individual and interrupting the nightmare without waking or disrupting sleep. Through machine learning, NightWare continually refines its model and knowledge of the person's response, consequently leading to fewer nightmare associated awakenings. In unpublished preliminary studies, NightWare was shown to be safe (no change in suicide risk or daytime sleepiness) and a tendency to have greater improvement in objective measures of sleep quality (i.e., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] and amendment for PTSD [PSQI-A]) compared to sham (NightWare but intervention disabled, i.e., no vibration). Whether NightWare improves cardiovascular health in adults with PTSD-related nightmares has yet to be studied.

Accordingly, the investigators are proposing a randomized, double-blind, placebo (i.e., sham intervention) controlled parallel pilot study that will provide the first clinical evidence for the efficacy of the NightWare digital therapeutic system to improve cardiovascular health outcomes in adults with PTSD-related nightmares.",Yes,No,Device	Device,The purpose of this study is to determine whether NightWare therapeutic intervention improves biomarkers of vascular aging and autonomic function in adults with nightmares related to PTSD.,NightWare Therapeutic Platform for Improving Cardiovascular Health in Adults With Nightmares Associated With PTSD,sleep	oxidative stress	aging	inflammation	sex/gender,"A wearable digital therapeutic platform consisting of an Apple Watch and iPhone pre-provisioned with Nightware intervention app that will deliver a mild vibration to the watch after detecting individual having a nightmare based on Nightware proprietary algorithm, arousing the individual and disrupting nightmare without awakening.

The COVID-19 global pandemic, along with mandated social and physical distancing, is expected to have substantial repercussions on public mental health and exacerbate the mental health crisis among teens. Adolescents, a group with significant unmet mental health needs, are at risk during this time, as they are especially vulnerable to depression and suicidality following environmental stressors, trauma, and social isolation that are endemic to this global pandemic. With difficulties in receiving in person care magnified during social distancing, now more than ever, there is an immediate need for safe, accessible, and effective digital treatments for mental health disorders.

The proposed intervention is intended to increase access to mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)- based digital treatment for adolescent depression (Limbix Spark) relative to psychoeducation. Limbix Spark implements behavioral activation (BA), a key CBT skill that provides a sense of pleasure or mastery through self-monitored activities to reduce depressive symptoms and improve functional outcomes.

Adolescents with depression (13-21 years old) across the country will be recruited to participate in a fully remote, clinical trial via https://www.limbix.com/spark. At an initial virtual visit, following informed consent, adolescents and parents (for those under 18) will fill out standardized questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general health. Participants will then download an app onto their mobile phone and be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will receive the Limbix Spark program and the other will receive the Psychoeducation program for 5 weeks. The Limbix Spark program is divided into 5 levels. Each level provides educational information about cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation, and interactive activities including mood tracking and activity scheduling. The Psychoeducation program is divided into 5 lessons. Each lesson covers a different topic about depression. During both 5 week programs, patients will also complete a weekly Patient Health Questionnaire, which is designed to measure depressive symptoms and also will report any negative side effects they may be experiencing. After 5 weeks, participants and legal guardians (for those under 18) will complete another set of standardized questionnaires designed to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and general health. Patients will also complete questionnaires asking them about their thoughts and experiences with the program they just completed. Lastly, a subset of patients and parents will be invited to complete a virtual interview to provide feedback on using the program.

The trial will be divided into two phases. The first phase will enroll 60 participants and participants will be randomized to either Spark and Control groups as described above. The second phase will enroll 175 participants and those randomized into the control group will be given access to the 5-week Spark intervention after completing the 5 weeks of control condition (control extension arm). Once completing the control extension arm, participants will complete a second set of post study questionnaires after 5 weeks.

All study participants that complete the 5-week Limbix Spark program and the post study questionnaires will be contacted and asked to consent to participation in the follow-up study. Only participants who did not opt-out to being contacted for future research will be contacted. This study will collect questionnaires from participants at any or all of the following time frames as indicated: 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month following completion of the Spark arm.",Yes,No,Device	Other,"Over 3 million teenagers in the USA have depression, and rates of depression and suicide are sharply increasing. Teenage depression has far-reaching consequences including impairments in academic and work performance and social and family relationships, substance abuse, and worsening of other health conditions, which can persist into adulthood. Access to mental health care for teenagers is limited due to a shortage of mental health providers and many teenagers and parents are reluctant to take antidepressants. COVID-19 and mandated physical and social distancing is expected to increase rates of teenage depression, and further limit access to traditional methods of care (e.g. psychotherapy). This highlights an urgent need to develop accessible, digital treatments for teenage depression to address the serious mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data from mobile health technologies in Parkinson's Disease (PD) have not been validated to use in the place of clinician rating scales. It is also not clear if the information obtained with the devices consistently correlates with change on the clinician scales and longitudinal motor decline. Technological challenges, such as the feasibility (safety, compliance) of use devices in patients with neurodegenerative disease, change in equipment and algorithms over time, collaboration with companies who may own patents, and other issues may also limit their use in healthcare and research. The purpose of this study is to compare data from a battery of novel mobile health technologies to standard-of-care validated patient questionnaires and clinician rating scales in PD patients.

This pilot study proposes that the use of Bluetooth glucometers and mobile health applications will be feasible and well accepted by the target population.

Methods: This project utilizes a quasi-experimental pre-post design with up to 25 participants. Over the course of eight weeks, participants will collect serum glucose logs (SGL) for four weeks using usual care followed by SGLs for four weeks using Bluetooth-enabled glucometers and the iGluco application. Measures will include a demographic sheet and completed SGL. Descriptive statistics of the appropriate level will be used to summarize the data collected. Glucose log completeness will be calculated using the total number of entries required for the period between visits divided by the number of actual entries. For example, if the participant has had 14 days between appointments, 56 entries would be expected, if the patient only records 40 results the completeness score would be 0.71. Raw data will be reported in the final manuscript under results. The data anticipated from this study include the number of women who consented to participate, average education level, primary languages, age range with mean age, the number of women on medication or diet only control, average completion score for usual care phase, and average completion score for the intervention phase.

We will stratify analyses across key patient characteristics, including type of pain condition, sex, age, race, ethnicity, State and zip code, Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes (a composite measure of population density, urbanization, and daily commuting), pain severity, opioid use, comorbidities, social support, and COVID-19 impacts (unemployment, financial hardship, family or personal COVID-19 diagnosis).",2024-03-31,Interventional,"Pragmatic Comparative Effectiveness Trial of Evidence-based, On-demand, Digital Behavioral Treatments for Chronic Pain",Treatment,OTHER,OTHER	OTHER	OTHER	OTHER,"We will perform a two-arm, multi-center, vRCT in a geographically diverse group of patients with mixed-etiology chronic pain. Using a random number generator, patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio between two self-administered, remotely deployed CBT delivery platforms, stratified by site: (1) a 2D mHealth app called PainTRAINER; and (2) 3D VR app called EaseVRx. The primary analysis will compare changes in pain intensity over two months upon completion of the standardized 8-week digital CBT protocols. Secondary outcomes will include pain catastrophizing, Coronavirus-related anxiety, pain interference, self-efficacy, and opioid use. Although complete patient blinding can be challenging in digital health studies, particularly those using VR, we will follow the VR-CORE guidance and previous VR trial precedent by informing patients that researchers are testing the effect of ""two types of audiovisual experiences on the perception of pain"". Because it is important for researchers to exhibit equipoise when describing the competing interventions, we will prepare a script that uses neutral language regarding the two interventions, as per previous VR research. In addition, data analysts will be blinded to patient allocation.

We will employ broad inclusion criteria to maximize the external validity of the study and generalizability of results. In consulting with our patient partners who co-developed this application, we opted to study pain and distress for individuals with all forms of chronic pain except active cancer treatment and end-of-life care. The population impacted by this research thus broadly encompasses individuals with many different types of chronic pain conditions, including somatic, musculoskeletal, neuropathic, and visceral pain. More than 60% of individuals with chronic pain are women, and although the point prevalence for chronic pain increases with age, 35% of individuals 45-54 years of age report some form of chronic pain condition, and often multiple pain conditions. In terms of race and ethnicity, 81-85% report their race and ethnicity as non-Hispanic White, 8-9% identify as non-Hispanic Black, and 5-9% as Hispanic.

This vRCT will be conducted remotely using a process our team has developed and applied in many previous virtual trials, including in a current NIH-sponsored trial for chronic lower back pain. Patients will be recruited using pre-existing large registries within our consortium and will complete consent forms, receive study materials, and speak with study staff all from their home without requiring in-person visits. Patients will be recruited from three major sites: (1) Cedars-Sinai Health System (CSHS); (2) Ochsner Health; (3) UAB. At all sites, participants identified by search tools will be contacted by a combination of mail, email, and patient-portal notifications and offered an opportunity to opt-in or opt-out; those who do not respond will receive a follow-up phone call.

We will compare two digital platforms, both currently in wide use and supported by evidence, that deliver self-administered, 8-week, home-based CBT-based treatment programs for patients with chronic pain and distress: PainTRAINER (2D mHealth intervention) and EaseVRx (3D VR intervention).

We will employ a biopsychosocial conceptual framework for monitoring outcomes in the trial, focusing on pain intensity as the primary outcome, and including a range of other relevant PROs selected in partnership with our patient partners. PROs will be collected via REDCap. Pain intensity will be measured using a standard 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) with a 24-hour recall. Consistent with NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) guidance, we will measure daily pain NRS for 7-days during baseline week 0, and again during the final week of the study (week 8). The minimally clinically importance difference (MCID) on the pain NRS is 2 points. Secondary Outcomes: Secondary outcomes will include the 4-item short form pain catastrophizing scale, 5-item Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, 8-item NIH PROMIS Pain Interference scale, 2-item Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and opioid usage in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). In addition, we will measure satisfaction with assigned treatment using the Pain Treatment Satisfaction Scale and will monitor for VR cybersickness using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ).

Chronic insomnia is often co-morbid with mental and behavioral health issues such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), which are common in these Veterans. Current behavioral interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) that are used to treat chronic insomnia are effective, but time-consuming. As a result, this largely younger, working cohort of Veterans does not use and benefit from these interventions as much as they could. The investigators will assess the usability and feasibility of two health information technology (HIT) tools for measuring objective and subjective sleep, and for self-managing chronic insomnia. An existing mobile sleep monitoring device used by some VA sleep clinics, the WatchPAT, will be used to measure objective sleep parameters in the Veteran's home. A benefit of this tool is that it can detect probable sleep apnea, which will permit referral of these Veterans for sleep apnea treatment instead of insomnia self-management. An existing VA mobile health application (or app), the CBTI Coach, can be used on a mobile device to teach skills to reduce insomnia based on the elements of manualized CBTI. The goal is to combine the WatchPAT and the CBTI Coach along with self-management guidance to help Veterans with chronic insomnia learn how to improve their sleep. As part of a 6-week pre-post intervention pilot usability and feasibility trial, patients will record their objective and subjective sleep at home at the beginning of the 6-week self-management trial and again at the end. Subjective sleep reports in the form of sleep diaries will be measured throughout the program as part of using the CBTI Coach app. The objective and subjective sleep reports will be combined and accessible from the mobile device and can be used to help guide sleep self-management by the participant. Self-management will be aided by self-management worksheets and features of the CBTI Coach App. Usability of the two HIT tools will be assessed within the conceptual framework of an Integrated Technology Acceptance Model via survey items about each of the HIT tools. Feasibility will be assessed using measures of the number of times that elements of the CBTI Coach were accessed during the 6-week program, and from a semi-structured qualitative interview conducted at the end of the program. In the interview, the investigators will obtain information about the barriers to and facilitators of use of the WatchPAT and CBTI Coach. If there is high use of these tools for insomnia self-management, then the pilot study will have provided important incremental value to the new VA CBTI Coach app. The investigators also will collect data about the user factors that impact use of the tools (e.g., depression, mild traumatic brain injury, age), and thereby either be able to target the tools toward those most likely to use them, or suggest further developments to increase use by potential users.

Cardiac arrest is a common and devastating emergency of the heart and the brain. More than 380,000 patients suffer out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) each year in the US. Improvements in cardiac resuscitation (the early links in the ""chain of survival"" for patients with OHCA) are tempered by our limited ability to resuscitate and protect the brain from global cerebral ischemia.

Neurological death and disability are common outcomes in survivors of cardiac arrest. Therapeutic cooling of comatose patients resuscitated from shockable rhythms markedly increases the rate of good neurological outcome, but poor outcomes still occur in as many as 50%, and the benefit of cooling in those resuscitated from asystole and pulseless electrical activity has not been shown in a randomized study.

Objectives:

The overarching goal of this project is to identify clinical strategies that will increase the number of patients with good neurological recovery from cardiac arrest. We hypothesize that longer durations of cooling may improve either the proportion of patients that attain a good neurological recovery or may result in better recovery among the proportion already categorized as having good outcomes.

Primary Objectives:

A. To determine, in each of two populations of adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (those with initial shockable rhythms and those with pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole), the shortest duration of cooling that provides the maximum treatment effect as determined by a weighted 90 day modified Rankin score B. To determine, in each of two populations of adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (those with initial shockable rhythms and those with PEA/asystole), whether increasing durations of cooling are associated with better outcomes or recovery implying efficacy of hypothermia to no cooling.

Secondary Objectives:

To characterize the overall safety and adverse events associated with duration of cooling To characterize the effect of duration of cooling on neuropsychological outcomes To characterize the effect of duration of cooling on patient reported quality of life

Design:

This study is a randomized, response-adaptive, duration (dose) finding, comparative effectiveness clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. The design is based on a statistical model of response as defined by the primary endpoint, a weighted 90-day mRS, across the treatment arms. The design will fit patient outcome data to a duration response model (separately for shockable and non-shockable rhythms), in which the potentially non-linear association between durations of cooling and the primary endpoint are estimated. All conclusions about the treatment arms are based on this model. The functional form of the duration-response model is flexible and able to fit many different shapes for the duration-response curve. Specifically it is parameterized to identify up to two change-points in the treatment effect across arms, allowing it to fit an increasing, decreasing, flat, plateau, or U-shape duration-response curve.

Subjects will initially be equally randomized between 12, 24, and 48 hours of cooling. After the first 200 subjects have been randomized, additional treatment arms between 12 and 48 hours will be opened and patients will be allocated, within each rhythm type, by response adaptive randomization. As the trial continues, shorter and longer duration arms may be opened. Specifically, a 6-hour duration arm will be opened if the emerging duration-response curve from 12 hours is flat. Similarly, a 60-hour or 72-hour duration arm will be opened if the emerging duration response curve shows an increasing treatment benefit through 48 hours.

This trial will have frequent interim analyses to stop the trial early for futility if it is highly likely that no treatment arm offers a greater benefit then the 6-hour duration arm.

Primary Outcome Measure:

The primary outcome measure will be the modified Rankin scale at 90 days after return of spontaneous circulation. The mRS will be analyzed as a weighted score incorporating both the proportion of subjects achieving a good neurological outcome and degree of residual functional impairment among those with good neurological outcomes.

Study Population:

Comatose adult survivors of out of hospital cardiac arrest that have already been rapidly cooled using a definitive temperature control method (endovascular or surface) will be enrolled in the emergency department or intensive care unit. Hub and spoke hospitals from the SIREN network will be enriched with high potential ancillary Hubs. Approximately 50 hospitals are anticipated to each enroll an average of 9 subjects per year.

Randomization:

Central computerized randomization by web-based interface will be used. Subjects will be potentially randomized over the course of the trial to the following possible durations of cooling (in hours): 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, and 72. The first 200 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to the 12, 24, and 48-hour durations only. After this initial ""burn in"" period, response adaptive randomization will be used to allocate subjects to durations inclusive of 12 to 48 hours initially, and then subsequently to the 6, 60 or 72 hour durations if specified conditions are met and the emerging duration-response curve suggests that the maximum treatment benefit might be on those durations. The response adaptive randomization probabilities for each arm will be determined separately for the two rhythm type populations. Randomization probabilities will be updated monthly, or approximately every 38 patients based on the expected accrual rate.

Consent:

Eligible patients for this trial will not have capacity to provide informed consent. Written informed consent from a legally authorized representative will be required.

Intervention:

The intervention will be random allocation to duration of cooling after cardiac arrest. Cooling in the study will be by a definitive temperature control method to a target temperature of 33 deg C. Any endovascular or surface cooling system with closed loop feedback will be allowed. Duration of cooling will be measured from the time that cooling with a definitive device is initiated in the hospital. As part of routine medical care, cooling may be initiated by emergency medical service (EMS) or in the emergency department. Eligibility will require that a temperature of <34 degrees C be obtained by 240 minutes after cardiac arrest. After the allocated duration of cooling is completed, controlled rewarming will be performed. Rewarming to a temperature of 36.5 deg C will occur over the shorter of 24 hours or a rewarming period equal to the allocated duration of cooling. Definitive cooling devices may be used for maintenance of normothermia after rewarming is complete. A clinical standardization guideline will be followed to reduce the effects of practice variability. Key physiologic and practice variables will be tracked and compliance with clinical standardization and deviation from physiologic targets reported back to study teams.

Statistical Analysis for the Primary Outcome Measure:

We will model the mean weighted mRS at 90 days across the treatment arms. The weighted mRS incorporates both the proportion of subjects achieving a good neurological outcome and degree of impairment among those with good neurological outcomes. The primary analysis is conducted separately for each rhythm type, allowing for a different treatment effect by rhythm type, and has two components. First, we identify the most likely target duration, where the target duration is the shortest duration that achieves the maximum treatment effect (Objective A). Second, we calculate whether the efficacy of any duration is superior to any shorter duration of cooling indicating a positive duration response (Objective B). Establishing a positive duration response implies confirmation that cooling is effective in improving outcome or recovery versus normothermia, when a normothermia control arm is not clinically acceptable.

A maximal sample size of 1800 subjects enrolled over 4 years (estimated accrual rate of 37.5 subjects/month) is anticipated.

The severity of symptoms in atrial fibrillation varies markedly, ranging from no symptoms to those with disabling symptoms. An ECG recording is currently mandatory for diagnosing atrial fibrillation.

The availability of long-term ECG and portable ECG registration for heart rhythm diagnostics within the healthcare sector is severely limited by waiting time both for ECG recording and for analysis and reporting. A method for heart rhythm diagnostics that is readily available is currently lacking in clinical practice, except for hospitalization, which is very costly and has low availability.

The lack of a method for diagnosis of heart rhythm disorders and atrial fibrillation that is readily available, cost-effective and simple to use is a problem for both the patients and for the healthcare system as a whole. The limited availability of patient-related diagnostics thus means that many patients, even those with symptoms, remain undiagnosed and thus untreated, which in turn means that the missing diagnosis gives an increased risk of stroke. If a standard smartphone could be used for reliable heart rhythm diagnostics, the availability could improve greatly.

Treatment with direct current cardioversion is a procedure in which the heart rhythm is normalized by an electrical shock through the chest. Patients with atrial fibrillation could in some cases be treated with cardioversion but the procedure is costly, has a high recurrence rate and includes an increased risk for thromboembolism and stroke. The benefit of the treatment is mainly symptomatic, with no proven long-term effects of mortality or morbidity.

In this study we will validate the use of a novel smartphone-based method for heart rhythm diagnostics when used by patients in their home environment after receiving treatment with direct current cardioversion. The novel method is using the smartphone camera as a sensor and records photoplethysmographic (PPG) measurements. We will also study the feasibility in using smartphone and mobile ECG recordings peri-cardioversion, to study the possible benefit of detecting pre-cardioversion spontaneous conversions to sinus rhythm and non-adherence to treatment with oral anticoagulants, both of which will lead to cancellation or detention of the cardioversion procedure. We will also detect the timing of post-cardioversion early recurrences into atrial fibrillation, as well as the heart rate and symptoms associated to recurrence, if any.

The objective of this study is to:

Validate heart rhythm measurements registered with a novel smartphone-based method using PPG-measurement technology compared to mobile ECG technology in patients with atrial fibrillation. The validation involves evaluating whether PPG-measurement technology using a novel smartphone-based method provides sufficient diagnostic performance in the home environment / outpatient environment compared to outpatient mobile ECG measurements.
Study if pre-cardioversion heart rhythm recordings will reduce the number of same day cancellations of treatment of atrial fibrillation with planned direct current cardioversion.

For the validation part, patients who visit the cardiac day care department at the department of Cardiology, Danderyd University Hospital, for treatment with outpatient direct current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter are asked about participating by physicians or research nurses. Each patient will prior to inclusion in the study be given full and adequate verbal and written information regarding the objective and procedures of the study and possible risks involved. Written consent is obtained from the physician or research nurse.

A 60-second heart rhythm measurement using a smartphone is recorded before the patient receives treatment with direct current cardioversion. The smartphone used is the same device that the patient will be using in their home for 30 days after the treatment. The measurement includes PPG-measurement from the camera of the smartphone as well as a simultaneous one lead ECG-registration done with a small ECG-device attached to the back of the smartphone.

The patient is interviewed about their medical history and their current symptoms. If the treatment is successful and the patient's heart rhythm is converted back to normal sinus rhythm, the patient is included in the study. The patient's heart rhythm is verified with an ECG measurement recorded approximately one hour after the cardioversion treatment.

When the patients are discharged from the hospital they are given a smartphone that they will be recording simultaneous PPG- and ECG-recordings with, at least twice daily for a period of 30 days post-cardioversion in their home.

For the clinical implementation part, patients scheduled for direct current cardioversion at Danderyd University Hospital will be included at least 2 weeks prior to the scheduled treatment. Information regarding co-morbidities, echocardiographic parameters and current medication will be collected from interviews and medical records.

All individuals scheduled for direct current cardioversion will be invited to a screening visit and asked to sign a written consent form. After consent, their heart rhythm will be recorded and those with sinus rhythm will be excluded. Participants with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter will be randomized 1:1 to pre-cardioversion heart rhythm monitoring, or no monitoring pre-cardioversion.

Participants randomized to active pre-cardioversion rhythm monitoring (intervention group) will be instructed in the use of smartphone rhythm recordings (using simultaneous PPG and mobile ECG). They will be recording both their heart rhythm and oral anticoagulant treatment adherence with the same smartphone application. This information will give the investigators the possibility to cancel or postpone the scheduled cardioversion visit in advance for those with spontaneous rhythm conversion to sinus rhythm and for those with non-adherence to oral anticoagulant treatment.

Participants randomized to passive pre-cardioversion rhythm monitoring (control group) will be instructed in the use of smartphone rhythm recordings (using simultaneous PPG and mobile ECG). The control group will be recording only heart rhythm and not treatment adherence. The heart rhythm recordings made in the control group will be reviewed after the participants treatment with direct current cardioversion.

OM PAIN APP (DESCRIPTION): The Oral Mucositis (OM) PAIN APP (App) is a smartphone application that was designed to permit patients to key in pain severity, using a visual analog 0-10 scale. The App is programed with an alarm to prompt the patient to record pain severity at prescribed intervals daily and through spontaneous patient input. Data collected on each patient's smartphone can be backed up wirelessly to a central server where the data can be analyzed remotely or data can be viewed on the device. The software is capable of generating a time-weighted measure of pain, total area under the pain cure (AUC), a summary measure that integrates serial assessments of a patient's pain over the duration of the study.

DAILY OBSERVATION: Subjects will receive a preprogrammed alarm four times a day from their smartphones prompting them to directly enter OM pain levels on the device. Patients may submit as many pain entries as they wish beyond the four minimum levels. Data recording will not commence until radiation starts. Because symptoms of mucositis do not commence typically until the third week of radiation therapy, and no sooner than week 2, recordings from week 1 will be used for baseline data. Recording of data will cease four weeks after the end of radiation therapy at which time mucositis symptoms typically start to resolve and pain symptoms substantially abate.

ACCELEROMETER: Each patient will be issued an accelerometer and will be encouraged to wear it continuously during the study period. To help determine whether decline in physical activity is associated with severity of pain, physical activity will be assessed directly with accelerometers (activity monitor). Participants will wear an accelerometer during sleep and waking hours, but not while bathing, starting one week prior to the start radiation therapy. Accelerometer output data will be obtained in 1-minute epochs that will be then summed to provide raw daily average activity units, which will be subsequently divided by 1000 for clarity.

Adding a daily side effect diary to a-DOT will further allow precise tracking of timing of both medication ingestion and side effects which may be compromising adherence. Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) is a new once-daily fixe-dose combination tablet which has achieved high rates of SVR ranging from 94 to 97 percent in genotype-1 infected patients including those with HIV/HCV coinfection and renal impairment. Zepatier is administered for 12 to 16 weeks, depending on HCV genotype, prior treatment history, and the presence of certain baseline NS5A polymorphisms (1a only). By administering Zepatier via this innovative a-DOT platform, the investigators hypothesize that PWIDs treated in real-wrold settings can be successfully treated with high rates of adherence and SVR.

In this proposed 18-month trials, 75 PWIDs enrolled in opiate agonist treatment (genotypes 1a and 1b) with chronic HCV will be enrolled over a 12-month period, and randomized to either aDOT or treatment as usual (TAU). The investigators will recruit PWIDs from diverse community settings include a syringe exchange program (NYHRE), federally-qualified health center (Comprehensive Health Care Center), homeless shelter (The Living Room), and a methadone maintenance treatment program (Montefiore Wellness Centers). All patients (inlcuding treatment-experienced and HIVV/HCV coinfected subjects) will be treated with Zepatier-based regimens as per the standard of care. Rigorous data are necessary to judge the contribution of a-DOT to the success of HCV treatment in PWIDs.

Successful HCV treatment leading to sustained viral response (SVR) is associated with increased survival, but to date successful treatment of PWIDs has been limited. Treatment of PWIDs is complex due to addiction, mental illness, poverty, homelessness, lack of positive social support, poor adherence-related skills, low motivation and knowledge, and poor access to and trust in the health care system. At Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the investigators have developed a multidisciplinary model of HCV care that integrates on-site primary care, substance abuse treatment, and HCV-related care within opiate agonist treatment clinics. To optimize HCV treatment outcomes, the investigators have introduced directly observed therapy (DOT). In the DOT model, one daily dose of oral HCV medication is administered with methadone. However, DOT is not feasible for PWIDs who are not enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment programs, and is less effective for methadone-maintained PWIDs who do not attend the methadone clinics every day. In addition, DOT has been used for decades both to measure and maximize adherence for treatment of tuberculosis infection, but the cost and logistical complexity of administering DOT for large HCV clinical programs would be prohibitive.",Smartphone Based Automated-Directly Observed Treatment Improves Adherence and SVR to Fixed-Dose Elbasvir and Grazoprevir in PWIDs: A Randomized Control Trial,Addiction	Sustained Viral Response	Adherence	Adverse Effects	Direct Acting Antiviral Agent	Chronic Hepatitis C	Resistance Development	Methadone Clinic	Primary Care	Directly Observed Therapy	Randomized Controlled Trial	Resistance	Reinfection	Treatment Outcome	Patient Navigation	Multi-Site	Liver Disease	Intervention,Smartphone App	Smartphone App with gaming.,AiCure	AiCure with gamification,"""smartphone"""

This gap exists despite the rapid growth of smartphone mindfulness applications and presence of mental health treatment gap. Specifically, no prior brief, smartphone mindfulness ecological momentary intervention (MEMI) has targeted generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Moreover, although theories propose that mindfulness intervention can boost attentional control (AC), executive functioning (EF), perspective-taking, and social cognition skills they have largely gone untested. Thus, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to address these gaps by assessing the efficacy of a 14-day smartphone mindfulness EMI (vs. placebo). Participants with GAD will be randomly assigned to either MEMI or self-monitoring placebo (SMP). Those in treatment will exercise multiple core mindfulness strategies (open monitoring, acceptance, attending to small moments, slowed rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing). Also, those in MEMI will be reminded before bedtime that mindfulness is a lifelong practice. Comparatively, participants assigned to SMP will only be prompted to practice self-monitoring.

The results will be compared with polysomnography, in order to achieve clinical and diagnostic validation. Three domains of devices will be used:

Movement sensors: Devices equipped with movement sensors (such as an accelerometer) able to monitor movement over the using period, converting this information in data related to the sleep-wakefulness cycle. In this category, the reference devices are the actimeters/actigraphs (ACT). Its use is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to the diagnosis of insomnia and circadian sleep disorders, and should be used for 3 to 14 consecutive days. Other wearable devices, such as smartwatches, are also used with the same purpose, although not validated for clinical use. In this study two wearable devices with movement sensors will be used, with the following minimal specifications: accelerometer in three axes, minimal sampling rate of 25Hz, maximum weight of 100g, battery lasting at least a week and support for Bluetooth connection. The desirable criteria are: light, body temperature and hearth rhythm sensors.
Wearable EEG band: EEG is a mandatory feature for type-1 polysomnography and a requirement for regular sleep staging. In this project, the EEG will be used in combination with actigraphy to allow a better estimation of sleep stages. In this study two wearable EEG bands will be tested, with the following minimal specifications: dry EEG electrode (no need of paste, gel or other conductor), presented as a head band or stripe, minimal sampling rate of 500Hz, noise, high and low filters, battery lasting at least 8h, maximum weight of 200g (including the whole device) and support for Bluetooth connection.
Smartphones: Additionally to the movement sensors and the EEG bands, the evaluation of sleep pattern will be based on smartphone-based accelerometers. This is the most common approach among the currently available sleep tracking applications, although is the least accurate. In this project the smartphones will be equipped with SleepUp's app and its sleep tracking functionality.

The project will be composed of three stages:

In the first stage, the use of the combination of actigraphy and EEG will be used for sleep staging in a sample of 12 healthy volunteers from 20 to 40 years old, both genders and with no sleep disorders for each combination of ACT+EEG. Considering there will two of each (thus four combinations), the final sample will be composed of 48 individuals.

The enrollment and application training may occur in two separate visits instead of one.

First visit - The first visit will include screening, enrollment and training on the application.

Enrollment: The screening process will include an eligibility assessment and a urine pregnancy test. Following successful screening, the site staff will provide the participants with study related information, perform an enrollment interview and receive an informed consent from the participants. During this visit, participants will complete baseline questionnaires that included information on the frequency and severity of their migraine attacks, typical associated symptoms, use of preventive and acute treatments, and the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life.

Application training: Eligible participants who enroll to the study will be trained to use the diary mode of the application that is installed on their own smartphones. The participants will be instructed to report the onset of all their migraines and headaches and complete a migraine diary questions regarding their pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as rate their stress level and functional disability at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment. At the beginning of each treatment, participants will also be asked to report the time elapsed from attack onset. The site personnel will be required to document the training session in the Case Report Form (CRF).

Run-in phase: After the enrollment visit, participants will undergo a 4-week migraine diary phase aimed to collect baseline migraine characteristics and further assess eligibility. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment. These reports will be transferred by the application to the electronic data capture (EDC) system, where they will be collected and registered.

Participants who report at least 6 qualifying migraine headaches with pain data at baseline and 2 hours post-treatment will continue to the treatment phase.

Second visit- Device training: Eligible participants who successfully complete the run-in phase will receive the Nerivio™ device. The device will be registered and connected by Bluetooth to their smartphone. During this visit, participants will be trained to use the device. Device training will include finding the optimal individual stimulation intensity level (perceptible but not painful), that will be subject to change during the treatment phase. The site staff will also carefully review with the patient how to identify a qualifying migraine headache (see below) and provide detailed instructions on study procedures.

If the research staff recognizes that the participant cannot tolerate the feeling of the electrical stimulation, the participant may be withdrawn from the study.

During the training, participants will also be informed on the key elements which are critical for the successful conduct of the study:

Treatments of migraine and headaches with Nerivio™ should be performed as soon as possible after migraine headache or aura began and always within one hour of symptoms onset. Treatments of mild headaches are accepted.
Avoid taking rescue medications within two hours post-treatment (2 hours from start of treatment), if possible.
The treatment should be performed for at least 30 minutes (the recommended treatment duration is 45 minutes).

The site personnel will be required to document the training session in the CRF.

Treatment phase: Participants will be instructed to use the device for the treatment of migraine and/or headaches (see below) as soon as possible and always within 60 minutes of onset during a period of up to 4 weeks. Participants will be instructed to use the device with the intensity level identified during the device training visit (and adjust as necessary) and make sure the stimulation is perceptible but not painful. Participants will be instructed to avoid taking rescue medications within 2 hours post-treatment. If medications are used, participants will be instructed to record in the app when and which medication was taken at 2- and 24-hours post treatment. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment. At the beginning of each treatment, participants will also be asked to report the time elapsed from attack onset. Adverse events will be reported throughout this phase of the study directly to the site staff.

Participants who do not achieve satisfactory relief at 2 hours post-treatment may treat again with the Nerivio™ device or may treat with usual care at that time or any time thereafter if the headache does not resolve. Participants will also be able to treat headache recurrence with the device. Migraine headaches that are not treated with the device may be treated with usual care.

The first reported treatment will be considered a ""training"" treatment, aimed to verify that the participants use the device properly, and will only be included in the safety analysis. The efficacy evaluation will be performed on the first treatment of a qualifying attack (see below) following the training treatment (hereby termed ""test treatment"").

Third visit- Follow-up phase:

Following the 4-week period of the treatment phase, participants will return to the clinic to fill questionnaires assessing satisfaction and user experience. All participants who complete the treatment phase will enter an additional 8-week phase in which the device can be incorporate into their usual care. Participants will treat their migraines and headaches according to their preference- treatment with Nerivio only, treatment with medication only, both treatment options, or none. Participants will be asked to report all their migraine headaches at onset (migraines or headache), regardless if they are using the device or not. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels, the presence/absence of aura and associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and allodynia) as well as the effect that their migraine attacks have on their daily routine and quality of life, at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment.

Fourth (final) visit - End of study:

Participants will return to the clinic following the end of the follow-up phase, at which time they will return the device.

Asthma affects nearly 25 million Americans, including 10% of U.S. adolescents. Teenagers are one of the most difficult groups to engage in self-management of chronic health problems like asthma and are at greater risk of poorly controlled asthma compared to younger children. Up to 80% of children with asthma are non-adherent to their controller medications, often due to lack of parent or child-perceived need or beneficial effects of these medications. Adolescents may have a higher threshold for initiating rescue treatment due to the perceived normalcy of asthma symptoms and frequently under-report symptoms to parents and healthcare providers.

Poor perception of asthma symptoms leads to overestimation of asthma control. Defining well controlled versus poorly controlled asthma is highly dependent on self-reported asthma symptoms. Up to half of patients with severe asthma symptoms report well controlled asthma. Many have low expectations of asthma control and have adapted to the disease so much so that they no longer perceive their limitations. Inaccurate self-reported data can be problematic in studies evaluating the impact of environmental factors or the efficacy of asthma treatments. An objective measure of asthma impairment is pulmonary function testing performed by spirometry. Ready access to a conventional spirometer is not always realistic in clinical care or research settings. The investigators propose integrating technology-based tools that leverage on the high rates of smartphone use among youth to identify early signs of deteriorating asthma control.

The Spirobank smart spirometer is a compact, portable, home-based spirometer approximately the size of an inhaler that pairs with a smartphone app called VitalFlo. The device uses an energy conserving turbine. Exhaled air flow causes the turbine to rotate, generating a voltage analogous to the rate of air flow across the turbine. The spirometer measures Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), or the volume of air that is exhaled in the first second. The device prompts the user to perform a minimum of three expiratory maneuvers in and records the best of the three maneuvers. The information generated is collected on a microprocessor and then transmitted by a low power Bluetooth radio to the VitalFlo App (password protected) on the user's iPhone. The user is alerted, by the App, if their expiratory effort is inadequate (such as early termination of exhalation) and is provided coaching for proper technique. The data is then transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant cloud database. Participants will receive a survey after each time they measure lung function to gather information about any asthma symptoms they are experiencing. Investigators will ask that they use the spirometer prior to using albuterol for symptoms if possible. VitalFlo will also track, via cloud databases, outdoor temperature, humidity, air quality, and pollen counts: all environmental factors that can influence asthma symptoms. Routine calibration is not needed. The eventual goal of home spirometer use is to identify drops in lung function preceding asthma symptoms to allow persons with asthma to intervene with rescue medications early in hopes of preventing progression to a more serious exacerbation of asthma (""red zone"") requiring healthcare utilization, such as emergency care or hospitalization.

This is a prospective single arm intervention study of 12-21 year olds with persistent asthma. Participants will be given the home spirometer after receiving instruction on proper use of the device. The participants will also receive an iPhone 5S (without SIM card) loaded with the VitalFlo app. Participants will be asked to use the spirometer at least twice daily (in the morning between 6am and 10am and in the evening between 6am and 10pm) and whenever rescue medication (albuterol) is administered or the participant feels symptoms of asthma (such as cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath) in order to document lung function. Pulmonary function testing is known to show diurnal variability. Investigators will use the morning and evening measurements to calculate the mean FEV1 for the day. After performing the spirometry maneuver, the user will be prompted to answer questions about their asthma symptoms. The lung function measurements and responses to the questions will be transmitted to a cloud-based HIPAA-compliant database and will be available for the investigators to download. Changes in lung function will be matched to subject-reported asthma symptoms and/or albuterol use.",Yes,No,Device,The investigators will study the use of a home-based spirometer (Spirobank Smart spirometer) that connects to a smartphone app (VitalFlo) in teenagers with persistent asthma to determine if clinically significant changes in lung function detected by the spirometer are associated with patient-reported asthma symptoms.,Evaluating Asthma Exacerbation-induced Changes in Lung Function With a Home-based Spirometer,,"The spirometer is a compact, portable, home-based spirometer that pairs with a smartphone app. Exhaled air flow causes the turbine to rotate, generating a voltage analogous to the rate of air flow across the turbine.

Determining whether it is possible to deliver more effective and wider reaching smoking cessation interventions to individuals with serious mental illness is a high priority. Smartphone apps are a wide-reaching technology that could provide individuals with serious mental illness the necessary skills for quitting. However, our research has shown that apps developed for the general public have inadequate levels usability and engagement in people with serious mental illness.

In a previous pilot trial of a tailored smoking cessation app for people with serious mental illness, Learn to Quit (NCT03069482), we identified successful recruitment and retention methods for smokers with SMI, demonstrated a 4-fold increase in objectively measured interactions of the novel app, obtained promising cessation rates for the experimental app (12% for Learn to Quit versus 3% for NCI QuitGuide), and identified a reliable methodological approach to conduct a fully-powered randomized controlled trial.

Based on this pilot work, we plan to conduct a clinical trial to test this new model in a diverse and representative sample of the SMI population. Specifically, the proposed trial will test whether a tailored smoking cessation app for people with serious mental illness, Learn to Quit, results in higher levels of smoking abstinence compared to a standard of care intervention for this psychiatric population, Brief Advice. Both interventions will receive combined nicotine replacement therapy. The second aim of this trial is to test a mechanistic model of app efficacy by examining mediators of app engagement and treatment outcomes. Finally, the trial will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions to inform public health policy regard the use of mHealth in this population.

In a multi-site, two-arm randomized controlled trial, 450 individuals with serious mental illness will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the experimental condition, participants will use the Learn to Quit app. In the comparator condition, participants will receive Brief Advice for smoking cessation. Participants in both conditions will receive combined Nicotine Replacement Therapy (standard dosing of nicotine patch plus 5 week course of nicotine gums).

Most hearing loss is sensorineural, meaning that the hearing loss is irreversible and requires rehabilitation. The majority of people with hearing loss have mild to moderate degrees, for which the most effective treatment options are hearing aids. Over the past few years, there have been many developments in hearing technology and the service delivery models in which they are supplied. Traditional hearing care models include several visits to a qualified hearing professional who must both perform diagnostics and prescribe hearing aids, which in the past has been the only way to obtain hearing aids. However, newer developments include forms of self-fitting hearing aids that enable a user to perform threshold measurements to determine the degree of hearing loss and automatically program and fine-tune hearing aids. These devices are now becoming available as direct-to-consumer (DTC) or over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids. Furthermore, alternative care models have been suggested to bolster access and uptake of assistive technology for hearing loss. Regulations on DTC and OTC hearing aids are starting to come into effect. In 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2016 directed the FDA to create a category for OTC hearing aids for adults with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss. In October 2021, the FDA formally proposed a rule to establish the OTC hearing aid category as part of this process. These changes in regulations would mean that soon, many of these self-fitting devices will become available. In response to these changes in service delivery models, the hearX group recently developed the Lexie Lumen hearing aids that can perform in-situ hearing threshold estimations and automatically prescribe hearing aid gain settings that closely approximate the gold-standard NAL-NL2 fitting prescription.

Inertia surrounding insulin initiation and titration is a specific problem. Various approaches have been proposed to help overcome clinical inertia, including support of patient self-management, and education for both physicians and people with diabetes. Presently, paper-based guides are available in which clinicians/educators rely on to help their patients in determining and recording appropriate insulin doses.

1272,NCT04607369,Enrolling by invitation,2019-01-09,"Inclusion Criteria for 4a and 4b:

The participant must have at least one eye which complies with all the inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria:

Patients have had a standard ICNVT in the last six months which could potentially qualify a patient's eye for study participation. This information will be used to determine whether to proceed with screening the patient with the remaining study selection criteria below.
In the proposed study eye, the patient has at least one scotoma or field-cut, metamorphopsia or doubling area that is non-overlapping and that has boundaries separated by more than 1 degree (the appendix describes ""degree"" measurements more fully). This means that if there are many scotoma's or areas of metamorphopsia or doubling, all but one is overlapping, the one that is not overlapping with required separation does qualify for the trial, while the others do not.
Age 18 or above 18 years old was selected as the minimum age because this study is only intended to evaluate patients who will follow directions well and can sign the consent alone.
If the patient uses corrective lenses, then if needed we will provide patients with an ophthalmologist configured optical trial lens frame with lenses configured to provide their near vision correction at 16 inches. We do this to eliminate the effect of multifocal or progressive lens viewing issues at near (from viewing through the wrong portion of the lens) on testing results. In a future study, potentially in this same trial, we may examine the effect of personal lenses on testing results. The patient must be able to tolerate wearing the optical trial frame without discomfort or problems viewing in these lenses.
Able to perform a short test provided in the clinic to measure if the patient can work with both the paper Amsler Grid as well as the Smart-phone Amsler grid. This test will be evaluated with standardized review and scoring by the Educator of the patient's performance, which will require an 80 percent score or better. The idea of this test is to be certain the combination of cognitive, motor and visual abilities of the patient is at the level that can easily for hold the paper grid (on a small clipboard) as well as hold the smart-phone in hand and for both modalities be steady enough to understand how to draw and to be able to draw on the paper and smart-phone Amsler grid per directions of the Educator. The provided iPhone 6 is technically similar to recent smart-phone models and demonstrates ease of use as tested by our team.
Visual acuity is to be no worse than 20/80 (LogMAR +0.50) at a viewing distance of 16 inches. At this distance the letter size will be 1.86 mm tall.
The patient must have the ability to directly focus on a 2.5 mm fixation point. This target is the size of the 20/80 Sloan optotype (LogMAR +0.50). In this fashion we can mostly ensure that direct, rather than eccentric viewing is performed. Eccentric viewing is not optimum for this trial as it may interfere with test repeatability if the eccentric viewing patient is not consistently using the same portion of their eye to view the test. Were this the case, the scotoma/field-cut positions may vary. It is acceptable for a scotoma or a field-cut to impinge on the fixation point as long as the density of the scotoma or a field-cut does not prevent direct viewing of the fixation point. The Eye Examiner EE (including the ophthalmologist and educator) will monitor and document whether the patient appears to be using direct visualization of the chart.
The patient's eyes should not be dilated.
The patient should have a static ophthalmic condition as determined by the sponsor that is not causing pain or discomfort and is not expected to change in the short timeframe between tests. Patients with recent eye surgery, should be stable as documented by Q & A with patient's eye care provider or in the patient's medical record if access is available.

Exclusion Criteria:

The participant must have at least one eye which complies with none of the exclusion criteria listed below.

A normal Amsler Grid with no scotoma or field-cut. Patients without Amsler defects are not the intended population of this study.
Before the education session, should the patient exhibit cognitive, motor problem (weakness, tremor, ataxia, etc.) or visual problems that prevent the patient from independently performing one or more of the near vision tests via the standard ICNVT or via SPNVT as described above in item 5 of Inclusion criteria.
Dilation of either eye on the day of and day prior to the trial examination because it limits accommodation as well as may increase in light sensitivity.
In the study eye, a scotoma or field-cut that is larger than 90% of the Amsler grid (90 cm2 or 360 squares).
In the study eye, the patient has scotomas or field-cuts, all of which are smaller than 0.0013% of the Amsler grid (0.13 cm2 or 1/2 of one Amsler grid square). Such small sized scotomas or field-cuts may reduce drawing accuracy on both Amsler Grid tests and may be undetectable on the 10-2.
Overlapping scotomas or field-cuts to all the scotomas present, because they add complexity to the study without adding value to the study results.
Two or more unreliable Visual Field test results. During the study, patient's visual field, will be tested using the Zeiss Humphrey® Field Analyzer 10-2 which will produce a ""Single Field"" outcome that includes reliability indices. The HFA 10-2 measurement to be carried out using the SITA standard test and the standard Goldmann III stimulus size. Only reliable VFs to be used in the analyses, defined as a fixation loss (FL) rate < 20% and a false-positive (FP) rate < 15%, following the manufacturer's recommendation for SITA measurements.
Should the patient appear to have unreliable parameters by 10-2 testing with one test, this test will not be evaluated, however, should the second 10-2 test be reliable, this test will be used to compare with the Amsler Grid results.

Individuals who fail the test in the office after training",2023-01-09,Observational,Implementation of the NEDS EyeCTester App,,INDUSTRY,UNKNOWN,"Detailed Description of 4A and 4B: A series of patients with central visual defects were identified and their names were given to the unblinded clinical coordinator. The clinical coordinator contacted the patients, described the study, arranged the appointments to come to the clinic one-at-a-time for a dedicated visit to participate in the study. Each patient experienced the same study process for their visit:

Met with the unblinded Clinical Coordinator who had the patient sign the informed consent after detailed explanation.
Had the Clinical Coordinator put a number tag on the patient, and this was the number that the blinded participants of the study were to use for these subjects. Additionally, random numbers were used on the test forms.
Patients met with blinded test trainer where the patient was provided standardized instruction for use of Amsler grid on-paper test, the Amsler grid on EyeQTester device, visual acuity and color sensitivity on paper and on the device. The instruction was enhanced between Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 as approved by the IRB for the different instruction protocol (see below discussion). Also, patients were given a test which they must pass in order to enter the trial.
Patients then met with the blinded test administrator where the patient took the tests with no coaching. The test admin confirmed that the environmental parameters were similar across all patients over the course of the study.
The patient completed test and re-test sequences.
All test results with assigned random numbers were reported by the test administrator to the Clinical Coordinator who provided batches of blinded results to the Data Coordinator.

The investigators knew from prior clinic experience that the patients required a new and more detailed educational experience than was standard in order to have more reliable results for both the paper and app Amsler Grid test, in order to measure the central visual fields. The investigators focused on carefully training the patient through both written material and a video where the educational administrator was there to review this with the patient. The education focused on:

What are ""defects"" and how to identify and report them.
How to draw the above defects with attention to distance from the fixation point, size of the defect as well as its density.

Training enhancement was prompted midway through the trial, when the unblinded sponsor and clinical coordinator reviewed patient test results. Initial conclusion was that the patients exhibited defect identification on both paper and app that could possibly be enhanced by improving the educational protocol. An updated educational protocol was provided which the sponsor discussed with the educational team which was implemented to test if this updated patient education would result in more reliable results. It was decided to utilize updated educational approach for all patients on both paper and the app. Additionally, the investigators, added a stylus for the app (replacing the patient's finger) in order to more closely simulate a pen which is utilized for the paper. This updated approach was submitted and approved by the IRB.

As a result of the above, a decision was made to have two cohorts in the study, the early education cohort 1 and the later education cohort 2. Patients in cohort 1 were trained on the device to draw a defect on the screen with the tip of their finger but on paper to use a pen. Patients in cohort 2 were trained on the device to draw a defect on the screen with a stylus and on paper with a pen. The result in Cohort 2 was that consistency of the patients test results were better for both test and re-test for both the Amsler grid on-paper and the EyeCTester device.

The statistical analysis in this report shows the overall results and also the improved results in Cohort 2 that likely is attributed to these educational enhancement and stylus additions.

The full protocol for the trial including the training is available in the WIRB trial documentation.

Sample Size Calculation by our statistician was verified to be the sample size used was statistically acceptable.

Summary: Amsler app and paper version were equivalent, and best when using a stylus on the app.

Detailed Description of 7A and 7 B A series of patients 22 and over without any vision problems being examined similar to the above (see WIRB description) with a different education protocol consisting of in-home video on the app, telemedical connection by COA to confirm teaching was understood, and if not reteach.

Specifically, the investigators will investigate Cloud-Based Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CB CGM) versus standard POC testing (Usual Care; UC) in increasing % time-in-range (70-200 mg/dL), and in decreasing % time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) and severe hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dL) among N=300 adults with T2D. Patients will be enrolled at Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego, Definitive Observation Unit (DOU) located in Hillcrest. This hospital serves predominantly low income, underinsured, ethnic/racial minority population in San Diego, California (CA). Participants will be randomized either to intervention or UC using a 4:1 ratio.

All participants will have a CGM inserted upon enrollment. For the UC group, CGM data will be blinded and used for evaluation only; glucose will be monitored via the hospital's standard point-of-care (POC) testing protocol. For the intervention group, CGM data will be non-blinded and transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant Digital Dashboard, which filters and prioritizes patients by clinical risk (algorithm-based) using real-time CGM data.

The Digital Dashboard will be monitored 24-hours/day by site-based telemetry teams for hyper- and hypoglycemic episodes that need rapid management per protocol. A centrally-located, Diabetes Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) will also remotely monitor glucose trends on the Digital Dashboard and recommend daily insulin adjustments to optimize the therapeutic regimen. Electronic medical records (EMR) will be used to identify eligible patients, and to compare exploratory outcomes (infection rate, LOS, healthcare costs, readmissions) between intervention and usual care.

Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of CB CGM versus UC in increasing % time-in-range (70-200 mg/dL).

Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of CB CGM versus UC in decreasing % time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) and severe hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dL).

Aim 3: To document the differences between CB CGM and UC in outcomes commonly affected by glycemic control in the hospital (infection rates, LOS, cost, 30-day hospital readmissions).

Process Aim: To evaluate feasibility, acceptability, sustainability, and scaling potential of CB CGM from patient, nursing, and physician perspectives.",Yes,No,Device,"Individuals with diabetes in the hospital often experience poor glycemic control, which places them at greater risk for infection, neurological and cardiac complications, mortality, longer lengths of stay, readmissions, and higher healthcare costs. There are few effective interventions for monitoring hospital glucose management therefore the long-term goal of developing Cloud-Based Real-Time Glucose Evaluation and Management System is to provide an effective, real-time continuous glucose monitoring solution necessary for clinical decision-making which can be easily managed for clinical risk 24 hrs/day. The innovative intervention will enable hospital care teams to take immediate steps based on wireless transmission of glucose data from the Dexcom G6 device, sent to a Digital Dashboard, where integration with existing real-world hospital processes can provide immediate prioritization to prevent or correct impending hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemic events. This randomized controlled trial is defined as a Phase III/IV definitive clinical trial to establish efficacy and effectiveness of this intervention. Aim 1 will assess mean differences of % time in range between intervention and Usual Care groups to find occurrence of glucose levels that are in range at 70-200mg/dL. Aim 2 will apply the same method, using % time above range of >300mg/dL (severe hyperglycemia) and % time below range <70mg/dL (hypoglycemia). Poor glycemic control in the hospital is common and given the known consequences of uncontrolled blood sugars during a hospitalization, health systems devote significant resources to developing protocols for improving glucometrics. The likely impact of this innovative research is to have an efficient, and seamless alternative for continually monitoring glucose levels in the hospital. The Digital Dashboard facilitates real-time, remote monitoring of a large volume of patients simultaneously; automatically identifies and prioritizes patients for intervention; and will detect any and all potentially dangerous hypoglycemic episodes. The work proposed pushes the limits of these challenges by providing evidence, identified by a team-based approach to glucose management in an underserved and understudied population supplementing prior data designed to improve outcomes among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related cardio metabolic conditions.

We propose the following specific aims:

Aim 1: To determine if an NMES and remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation intervention reduces 30-day all cause readmissions in patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of COPD. Skeletal muscle dysfunction is associated with the number of hospital admissions, duration of hospital stay and total number of exacerbations. We and others have shown that applying NMES results in significant improvements in quadriceps muscle strength. It is plausible that targeting skeletal muscle dysfunction will result in improved respiratory outcomes. Based on our preliminary results comparing our exercise intervention with historic data, we hypothesize that a combination of early in-hospital and home NMES and home pulmonary rehabilitation using smart technology will prevent hospital readmissions following an acute exacerbation of COPD.

Aim 2: To evaluate the effects of an NMES and remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation intervention on muscle strength, dyspnea and respiratory quality of life in COPD post hospital discharge. Skeletal muscle dysfunction contributes to the morbidity associated with acute exacerbations, results in a longer duration of hospital stay and a shorter time to readmission, and is associated with more frequent exacerbations. We hypothesize that by preventing deconditioning, improving muscle bioenergetics and positively affecting muscle strength, NMES and home pulmonary rehabilitation will improve respiratory quality of life, dyspnea and functional capacity. We will compare outcome measures for respiratory morbidity at baseline with those at 12 weeks.

Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of NMES and remote tele pulmonary rehabilitation intervention on systemic and muscle inflammation. Acute exacerbations of COPD are associated with sustained systemic inflammation and the mechanism for this may be perpetuation of inflammation by a skeletal muscle reservoir. We have previously shown that older patients such as those with COPD are more susceptible to muscle inflammation. Based on our preliminary results showing significant benefits, we hypothesize that the reduced readmission rates are a direct effect of lowering muscle inflammation. We hypothesize that inflammation arising from the lungs is perpetuated by pro-inflammatory signaling in the skeletal muscles that sustains systemic inflammation, and this can be reduced by a combination of early NMES and exercise therapy at home by reducing skeletal muscle production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will perform quadriceps muscle biopsy at baseline and at 4 weeks to demonstrate reduction in pro-inflammatory signaling in skeletal muscles at 4 weeks in the intervention arm and anticipate that this reduction will be associated with reduction in systemic inflammation.",Yes,No,Device,"This is a prospective randomized controlled study to test the hypothesis that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and remote pulmonary rehabilitation at home offered via a smart technology, called Smart TeleHealth, results in a reduction of systemic inflammation, via reduction of skeletal muscle tissue inflammation, and thereby improves functional capacity, and thus, reduces the rate of readmissions following hospitalization for acute exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

Biofeedback instruments measure physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function, breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature and rapidly and accurately provide feedback information to the user. There are various aims biofeedback can target, e.g., developing more awareness or control for physiological processes and thus, consciously reducing muscle tension. Previous research has shown findings of higher baseline muscle activation and abnormal EMG as a response to stress in chronic back pain patients.

Studies using biofeedback for the treatment of chronic back pain have shown inconsistent results and it is difficult to draw conclusions based on previous studies due to variability in sample size and characteristics, biofeedback modality, treatment conditions, and control groups. Thus, the effectiveness of biofeedback in reducing the symptomatology of back pain patients remains unclear. The investigators therefore are planning to conduct this pilot efficacy study, to examine the effects of EMG-biofeedback (EMG-BF) on pain-related outcomes in a cohort of Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) patients.

This randomized clinical trial has two study arms. Participants in the first arm will receive the experimental condition (EMG-Bf) and those in the second will continue their usual care and serve as a control group. Both groups will be asked to complete self-report questionnaires before their first visit and after the last visit at 8 weeks. Further, both groups will undergo Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) before their first visit and after the last visit at 8 weeks. The specific aims of this study are to examine the impact of EMG-BF on pain intensity and sensitivity and on physical functioning, sleep, pain catastrophizing, anxiety and depression. We will not modify pain medication regimens in any of the trial arms and no pain medication prescriptions will be issued by the research team at any time.

1) EMG-Biofeedback EMG-BF facilitates neuromuscular retraining and muscle relaxation by using audio and visual stimuli using an EMG surface electrode-based biosensor and a software installed on a tablet or smart phone. During the weekly sessions participants will be instructed on how to use the device by a trained biofeedback instructor. Further, in each session participants will have the opportunity to discuss possible difficulties/obstacles/progress using the device. Each session will additionally include relaxation techniques (such as Progressive Muscle Relaxation). Sessions are estimated to last 40-45 minutes.

Standardized Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) QST is a non-invasive method for measuring pain sensitivity and pain modulation. Our QST testing protocol will measure mechanical pain sensitivity (pain threshold). This protocol has been used in various studies the investigators have conducted in the past. During the psychophysical testing procedures, participants will be informed that they may terminate the procedure at any time. The intensity of pain stimulation will be determined for each subject individually to minimize potential for tissue damage. The methods used have been thoroughly tested and validated for the study of experimental pain. All subjects will be examined during the study to document the presence or absence of tissue injury at the sites of noxious stimulation. If there is any evidence that the protocol causes more than minor, reversible bruising or sensitization, the protocol will be amended to decrease the frequency and/or intensity of the noxious stimuli.

Automated day and night closed-loop insulin delivery (intervention arm) combined with low glucose feature (interventional arm) - Participants in the closed-loop group will receive additional training sessions following randomisation covering the use of the study insulin pump and real-time CGM, prior to starting closed-loop insulin delivery.

Once confident with the use of the study pump and CGM system, participants will receive training required for safe and effective use of the closed-loop system approximately 2-4 weeks after randomisation. During this 2-4 hour session participants will operate the system under the supervision of the clinical team. Competency on the use of closed-loop system will be evaluated.

Thereafter, participants are expected to use closed-loop for 6 months without direct real-time remote monitoring.

Insulin pump therapy (control arm) - Refresher training on key aspects of insulin pump therapy will be provided.

Subjects will continue using their own insulin pump for 6 months.

3-month and 6 month assessments:

A blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c and a urine pregnancy test in females of child-bearing potential.
Validated surveys evaluating the impact of the devices employed on quality of life, psychosocial and cognitive functioning, diabetes management and treatment satisfaction will be completed.
Participants of both study arms will be fitted with blinded CGM systems at the end of each follow up visit. The sensors will be worn at home for up to 14 days and will be sent back to the research team.

6 months only: Subjects/guardians will be invited to join follow-up focus groups to gather feedback and reactions to their current treatment (closed-loop or insulin pump), the clinical trial, and quality of life changes.

Study Contacts: In between study visits, participants will be contacted by the study team (email or phone) once monthly in order to record any adverse events, device deficiencies, and changes in insulin settings, other medical conditions and/or medication.

In case of any technical device or problems related to diabetes management such as hypo- or hyperglycaemia, subjects will be able to contact a 24-hour telephone helpline to the local research team at any time. The local research team will have access to central 24 hour advice on technical issues.

--Procedures for safety monitoring during trial: Standard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events will be in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE) and specific adverse events (AE) such as severe hypoglycaemia.

Subjects will be asked to test and record blood ketones if their finger prick glucose is > 16.7mmol/l (300mg/dl) upon awakening, >300 for more than 1 hour, or >22.2mmo/l (400mg/dL) at any time as part of the safety assessment for DKA.

A data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will be informed of all serious adverse events and any unanticipated serious adverse device effects that occur during the study and will review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals.

--Criteria for withdrawal of patients on safety grounds: A subject, parent, or guardian may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop the closed-loop intervention after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons are:

Serious adverse events
Significant protocol violation or non-compliance

Patients with controlled blood glucose have a lower mortality rate than those who are uncontrolled. However, a rigid blood glucose control - which may lead to hypoglycemia- is associated with higher mortality rates. Thus, adequate glucose monitoring is important for hospitalized diabetic patients.

Previous studies have shown that CGMS, in the outpatient setting, engender better glycemic control thereby reducing risk of hypoglycemia. CGMS offer a replacement for finger stick blood glucose monitoring which may not identify an incidence of hypoglycemia until symptoms drive the patient to test. Furthermore, finger stick blood glucose monitoring is painful and time consuming thus causing many patients to avoid this aspect of diabetes self-care management.

Patients with a history of urolithiasis are a segment of the population that can benefit from meeting physician-recommended fluid consumption guidelines. Preliminary studies with this population have revealed patient interest in using various technologies (i.e., wrist-worn sensors, smart water bottles, mobile applications) to increase their fluid consumption but the investigators are not aware of any that combine multiple technologies. The investigators' long-term goal is to examine if just-in-time reminder notifications to drink following periods when patients have not been drinking will increase compliance among patients with a history of urolithiasis. To prepare for that study, the investigators seek to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the sipIT tools in this study.

This study is part three of a set of studies aimed at determining the feasibility of using technology to increase compliance with fluid consumption guidelines. Preliminary data included 1) a focus group of participants with a history of urolithiasis and 2) a lab study to examine the feasibility of using wrist-worn sensors to detect non-alcoholic drinking events. Data from the focus group revealed that participants are interested in using a variety of technologies (e.g., wrist-worn sensors, smart water bottles, mobile applications) to assist with increasing fluid consumption.

Participants are being asked to take part in this study because they suffer from persistent headaches.

Device description:

The device is a wireless wearable battery-operated stimulation unit controlled by a dedicated smartphone application. Treatments with Nerivio™ are self-administered by the user at the onset of a headache. The Nerivio™ includes several main components:

A pair of electrodes covered with hydrogel and a removeable protective film
An electronic circuitry and a battery
A software that includes firmware and a software application for mobile platforms
An armband to secure the attachment of the device and enable a discreet treatment

Procedures and duration of participation

Participants will receive a device and will be asked to treat headaches with it and report in the app the characteristics of the attacks at the beginning of the attack as well as at 2 hours after the treatment. The study includes 3 visits to the clinic. The investigators expect that participants will be in this research study for 8 weeks.

Why is this research study being done?

Participants are being asked to be in the study because they suffer from persistent headaches.

The Nerivio device is approved by the FDA for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in patients 12 years of age or older. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the Nerivio device for treating New Daily persistent Headache (NDPH) in children. The Nerivio is a non-invasive device operated via a smartphone application that changes brain activity. The device is worn on the upper arm, and the treatment is self-administered at the headache onset. The device delivers non-painful electrical pulses to the skin that stimulate the body to initiate a pain inhibition mechanism in the brain. During the treatment, the users can adjust the intensity of the pulses according to how they tolerate it.

Marc DiSabella is the person responsible for this research study at Children's National. He is called the Principal Investigator.

What will happen in this research study?

Each participant will receive a device to be used at home for the acute treatment of their headaches. The device produces electrostimulation parameters aimed to relief headache pain.

Telemedicine Monitoring of Adults with Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus (Tele-MONITOR DM) is designed to reduce health care disparities in under resourced populations by enhancing existing telehealth visits for individuals with poorly controlled diabetes through continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with data automatically transmitted to a clinic dashboard to allow for outreach to patients as needed in between routinely scheduled visits and feedback to primary care providers for medication management.

Few people with diabetes reach their treatment targets. This is particularly true for the under resourced who lack access to medical care who often have very high glucose levels, as well as have a risk for hypoglycemia. For our patients, part of the difficulty in accessing care is the disruption it creates in their schedule to take the time to come in for an office visit. The use of telemedicine due to the COVID pandemic has expanded our ability to reach patients in a convenient manner, based on the patient's preferences rather than a fixed clinic schedule. Use of technology has increased along with this, particularly because Medicare rules for covering technology have expanded. This allows for close monitoring and frequent medication dose adjustment to treat both hyper- and hypo-glycemia. These lessons learned during COVID create a new opportunity to expand the use of technology to underserved areas where uptake has been lagging but where the need is greatest.

Our system of monitoring, which the investigators originally called Tele-CGM will send alerts to our clinic that will allow for outreach to patients who need assistance, rather than waiting for them to contact the clinic. By looking both at the daily alerts as well as weekly data updates on each patient, the investigators should help keep patients safer, start and uptitrate guideline-recommended medications more effectively and work to encourage adherence to lifestyle and medications. Originally, the investigators had hoped to develop our Tele-CGM system to include data from all CGM systems. Unfortunately this is not currently possible. Therefore the investigators plan to work the Freestyle Libre 2. The data will be monitored through the existing LibreView system, with enhanced functionality for population management. The CGM system selected for each patient will be individualized based on the patient's preferences, clinical need for the device and insurance coverage (if available). For those without a CGM, they will be provided with a Freestyle Libre device free of charge.

If our findings prove the utility of our system, it will validate the role of treatment intensification for diabetes management in primary care, using asynchronous data collection from CGM devices by diabetes educators supervised by an endocrinologist. It will also assess the utility of a device-dashboard that will provide near real-time alerts to clinic staff so that they can respond to unusually high and low blood glucose values as well as discontinuation of sensor use.

A commercially available Libre 2 CGM device will be provided and a sensor will be inserted. The participant will receive instructions on calibration, insertions, maintenance, use, and removal of the sensor. The Libre 2 CGM is linked to the LibreView program which captures CGM data and initiates alerts based on the following parameters:

≥4 hours without CGM signal
≥2 hours 54 - 70 mg/dl
15 minutes <54 mg/dl Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) - The PHQ-8 is an eight-item scale developed specifically to screen for depression. Each question has a choice format of the number of days in the past two weeks the question apply to them (Not at all 0-1day, Several days 2-6 days, More than half the days 7- 11 days, and Nearly every day 12-14 days). Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.

Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) - The DTSQ assess patient satisfaction with diabetes treatment each. It is composed of eight questions, each of which is scored by patients on a scale ranging from zero (e.g., ""very dissatisfied"", ""very inconvenient"") to six (e.g., ""very satisfied"", ""very convenient""). The questionnaire is composed of two different factors. The first factor assesses treatment satisfaction and consists of six questions (Q 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). These six questions ask about ""satisfaction with current treatment"", ""flexibility"", ""convenience"", ""understanding of diabetes"", ""recommend treatment to others"" and ""willingness to continue"", respectively. The second factor consists of two questions (Q 2 and 3), which assess the burden from hyper- and hypoglycemia, respectively (zero being ""none of the time"" to six being ""most of the time""). Treatment satisfaction is assessed as the sum of the scores of the six questions on the first factor (total score 36), with a higher score indicating higher treatment satisfaction. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.

Glucose Monitoring Satisfaction Survey (GMSS) - The GMSS assess treatment satisfaction with glucose monitoring devices and its impact on quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is a 15 item scale asking subjects how much they agree or disagree (Likert scale 1-5) with each statement as it pertains to their current glucose monitor. There are 4 sub-scales Openness, Emotional burden, Behavioral burden, and Trust (for type 1) Worthwhileness (for type 2). Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.

Diabetes Distress Scale for T1D (DDS T1D) - The DDS T1D is a 28-item self-report scale that highlights seven critical dimensions of distress: powerlessness, management distress, hypoglycemia distress, negative social perceptions, eating distress, physician distress, and friends/family distress. The seven sub-scales include:

Powerlessness: A broad sense of feeling discouraged about diabetes; e.g., ""feeling that no matter how hard I try with my diabetes, it will never be |good enough."" Management Distress: Disappointment with the patient's self-care efforts; e.g., ""feeling that I don't give my diabetes as much attention as I probably should."" Hypoglycemia Distress: Concerns about hypoglycemic events; e.g., ""feeling that I can't ever be safe from the possibility of a serious hypoglycemic event."" Negative Social Perception Distress: Concerns about the possible negative judgments of others; e.g., ""feeling like I have to hide my diabetes from other people.

Eating Distress: Concerns that the patient's eating is out of control; e.g., ""feeling that thoughts about food and eating control my life."" Physician Distress: Disappointment with the patient's current health care professionals; e.g., ""feeling that I don't get help I really need from my diabetes doctor about managing diabetes."" Friend/Family Distress: A perception that there is too much focus on diabetes amongst the patient's loved ones; e.g., ""feeling that my family and friends make a bigger deal out of diabetes than they should."" Higher scores indicate higher stress. Administration time is approximately 15 minutes.

Diabetes Distress Scale for T2D (DDS T2D) - The DDS T2D is a 17 item self-report scale that reflects overall diabetes distress from all sources with four sub-scales:

Emotional Burden (5 items): feeling overwhelmed, frightened or fearful about managing the demands of diabetes over time.

Regimen Distress (5 items): feeling that they are failing by not managing their diabetes well, e.g., meal plan, exercise, etc.

Interpersonal Distress (3 items): feeling that they are not receiving sufficient support for their diabetes among family and friends.

Physician Distress (4 items): worries about health care and obtaining sufficient expertise, support and direction from health care providers.

Each question is rated on a 6-point scale from (1) ""not a problem"" to (6) ""a very significant problem."" Higher scores indicate higher stress. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.

Assessment of Sever Hypoglycemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis -The Assessment of Severe Hypoglycemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis is an interviewer administered survey assessing if the subject had any episodes of severe hypoglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis since their last study visit. Events are recorded to assess frequency, as is type of assistance required to treat the event. Administration time is approximately 5 minutes.",Yes,No,Device,"The purpose of this single center observational study is to determine the effect of continuous remote continuous glucose monitor (CGM) reporting coupled with a telemedicine intervention (Tele-CGM program) on levels of HbA1C in adults with poorly controlled type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

After ablation, patients are usually discharged with transtelephonic monitor. Patients are encouraged to send their electrophysiologist transmissions of their heart rhythm at least once a week or anytime they have symptoms. After 3-4 months of remote monitoring, patients come for their first visit after the ablation. At this visit, the electrophysiologist reviews the heart rhythm transmissions since the ablation and based on the findings, decisions are made regarding anticoagulation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy. If all transmissions show sinus rhythm and the patient is doing well, he or she is normally followed clinically based on symptoms without any rhythm monitors.

Users are not obligated to provide personal information and could treat without providing any feedback. The app includes a secured, personal migraine diary, which enables patients to record and track their migraines and other headaches. At the beginning of each treatment, and again 2 hours after the start of treatment, patients are prompted to record their symptoms, including pain level (none, mild, moderate, severe), functional disability (No limitation, Some limitation, Moderate limitation, Severe limitation), and an indication of which medications, if any, were taken within that 2-hour time window.

Post-marketing surveillance is designed to assess the efficacy and safety in larger and more diverse populations and in various real-world environments and situations. As a digital therapeutic device (i.e., electroceutical), the REN device enables prospective collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes in real-world clinical practice.

A hypo means that the brain does not get enough energy. A person can become confused, dizzy, pass out, and/or have a fall.

Older people with diabetes often seek treatment in hospital for symptoms such as falls, dizziness or feeling muddled. Health care professionals will order tests to investigate the possible causes for the fall, being muddled or dizzy, which can include a review of medications, checking blood pressures and the heart.

However, it has previously been difficult to obtain 24-hour blood sugar monitoring in older people with diabetes to check if hypos could be an important contributing factor to their falls and dizzy spells.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) allows non-stop monitoring with a sensor that sits just under the skin. This sends sugar readings to a smartphone every few minutes (via Bluetooth) for 10 days. This enables full evaluation of the amount of time a person's sugar is in the target range, and the time in the low/high ranges.

Medical therapy is not always effective for managing GI cancer pain; there is a need for drug-free alternative to complement or even replace medical therapy, such as opioids. This study will evaluate a novel technology called virtual reality (VR). Users of VR wear a pair of goggles with a three-dimensional screen that creates a sensation of being transported into lifelike worlds. Evidence shows that VR can reduce pain through many different mechanisms. Research shows that VR can also help train people in new skills, such as to meditate, breathe deeply, and learn how to cope with pain.

In this study, patients with GI cancer pain will be randomized into three groups of equal size: (1) immersive skills-based VR therapy; (2) immersive distraction VR therapy; and (3) non-immersive sham VR using 2D videos displayed in a VR headset. The skills-based treatment will use virtual healing environments to teach patients about meditation, breathing exercises, and pain management. The distraction treatment will use immersive videos that are designed to take the mind off of pain. The sham VR will use VR goggles, but patients will only watch a two-dimensional video rather than a 3D, immersive experience.

Eligible patients will have GI cancer pain, meaning belly pain at least 5 points above the nationally average on the NIH PROMIS GI Scale as well as having a GI cancer diagnosis. . The study will exclude people who are under 13 years of age, unable to understand the consent form, expected to live less than 3 months, brain tumors not responding to treatment, or injury that makes it difficult to wear something on their face.

Randomization between groups will occur using a computer program called REDCap and will be performed at the time of obtaining patient consent for participating in the study. The VR goggles will be provided to patients in all three groups at the time of their doctor visit at Cedars-Sinai, along with instructions for use. Patients will then be asked to actively use the headset for four weeks on a daily basis, following the specific instructions for their assigned intervention. In addition, patients will wear a Fitbit watch on their wrist during the study, as tolerated, to monitor step counts and sleep. Finally, participants will fill out a set of questionnaires once a week by computer, or by paper survey if they do not have access to a computer.

In order to show a difference between the active VR treatments and the sham VR control treatment, the investigator will recruit a minimum of 120 patients in each arm of the study. This calculation is sufficient to demonstrate clinically meaningful differences in the primary outcome, which is Gastrointestinal belly pain levels as measured by the NIH Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System, or PROMIS® questionnaire. PROMIS is a well-validated set of questionnaires that measure different aspects of quality of life; for this study the investigator will focus on PROMIS Gastrointestinal belly pain, Global physical and mental health, and Social isolation. Daily pain catastrophizing, Milligram morphine equivalent daily dose, Simulator sickness, Pain treatment satisfaction, Pain self-efficacy (PSEQ), baseline demographic information, Pain Diary, and Pain Behaviors will also be measured. The investigator will compare the number of steps taken per day and sleep levels among the three groups using statistical tests that account for potential difference among the groups. Finally, the investigator will perform statistical analyses to identify whether there are individual patient characteristics that predict response to VR therapy. The goal will be to develop a mathematical algorithm that optimized patient selection to make more precise treatment decisions with VR.

Users of VR wear a pair of goggles with a close-proximity screen in front of the eyes that creates a sensation of being transported into lifelike, three-dimensional worlds. To date, VR has been limited to short-term clinical trials for cancer pain. Moreover, limited research exists on theory-based VR modalities beyond mere distraction, such as VR that employs acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with components of biofeedback and mindfulness.

A pain assessment will be conducted, and this will be obtained verbally from the patient. Physical examinations will be obtained at the initial study visit and will be documented in the source documents.

The participants will be instructed to use the GLED or the WLED devices as follows:

Before surgery - The participants will be instructed to choose rooms in their home. These rooms must be dark and has no other source of light except the light device provided. The participants will be instructed to place the devices in their fields of vision and keep it between 3 feet away from their eyes. This distance is chosen based on the intensity of the light from our clinical trial, which corresponds to 100 lux. The participants will be asked not to stare directly at the light, but to rather allow it to enter their eyes from the periphery and to treat it as they would treat any other light fixture. The participants will be asked to have 2 hours of exposure every night. Given that participants may have different preferred time to go to bed, we will ask them to start the exposure any time after sunset when sunshine is no longer illuminating their chosen rooms for exposure. We will encourage the participants to participate in any activities that do not require additional lights so they do not fall asleep during the nightly light exposure. For example, the participants may enjoy reading (100 lux provide enough illumination for reading), listening to music, exercising, etc. The participants will be exposed nightly to their light for 8 weeks prior to surgery.

After Surgery - On average, half the participants may be discharged home from the hospital after they recover from anesthesia in the same day. The other half of the participants may be admitted to the hospital for 1-3 days on average based on their medical profile, the course of the surgery, and any complications or concerns of the surgeons or the anesthesiologists. For patients that will be discharged home on the same day, they will continue light exposure as they did before surgery. For patients who may be admitted to the hospital, we have already secured the approval from the hospital administrative staff as well as the nursing manager to allow the participants to utilize the light devices in the patients' rooms. The light devices were examined by the Facility Management (for electrical hazards) and Infection Control and both approved the use of the light devices in the hospital setting. The participants will place the light devices in their fields of vision in the patients' rooms. Patients and nurses are able to control the ambient lights in the rooms and it will be kept dark except for the light from the light devices for two hours every night. The participants will be exposed to the light for 2 hours in the evening prior to sleeping. If the surgery is scheduled late at night or if the participants has a slow emergence from anesthesia, they may not be awake during the first night in the hospital to have the light exposure. Once participants are discharged from the hospital, they will continue exposure to the light as they did before surgery for the remainder of the two weeks postoperatively.

medical illness or surgery). Uncertainty exists as to whether AF Occurring Transiently with Stress (AFOTS) is secondary to a reversible precipitant and is benign, or is a first presentation of paroxysmal AF and associated with a risk of stroke. AFOTS is a common occurrence (>40% in some intensive care settings), but there is a lack of evidence to guide its management and guidelines have called for further research in this area. Retrospective data suggest that many patients with AFOTS (>50%) will experience recurrent AF. These estimates were obtained without using sensitive methods for AF detection, which raises the possibility that the true rate of recurrent AF is much higher. As the rate of recurrent AF increases, it becomes increasingly likely that AFOTS is just the first detection of typical ""clinical"" AF.

Objective To use a sensitive strategy to determine the rate of recurrent AF among patients who experienced AFOTS following i) non-cardiac surgery OR ii) medical illness, compared to matched controls.

Methods Two multi-centre, 138-patient, observational cohorts. AFOTS patients will have new AF, documented by 12-Lead ECG or surface monitoring, during hospitalization for non- cardiac surgery (Cohort 1) or medical illness (Cohort 2).

Controls will be patients without a history of AF who are matched for age (within 5 years), sex and exposure to stressor. Participants will wear a 14-day ECG monitor at 1 and 6 months after discharge. The endpoint is detection of AF.

Impact

If the incidence of AF after AFOTS is >80%, clinicians could be advised to treat AFOTS like ""clinical"" AF and initiate anticoagulation according to guidelines. Otherwise, a strategy of surveillance for AF would be advised.

Hypothesis

Patients who experience AFOTS will have a higher future incidence of AF and of stroke compared to patients exposed to a similar stressor but who did not develop AF.
The risk of recurrent AF after AFOTS will be sufficiently high (> 80%) to warrant routine initiation of long-term OAC in all cases.",Atrial Fibrillation Occurring Transiently With Stress (AFOTS): Understanding the Risks of Recurrent AF.

In addition, there is the option to interact with the VR environment using a tap pad located on the side of the helmet. Therefore, the child will be receiving distraction via 3-D visual and auditory sensory, and tactile feedback, thus supplying a multi-sensory immersive experience. The VR HMD runs independently of a smartphone and has active matrix LCDs with high pixel resolution, creating a bright, vibrant color and a quality image.	The Mira Prism is a portable, augmented reality (AR) HMD powered by iPhone. When paired with the iPhone, the Mira Prism goggles can superimpose computer-generated images on the user's view of the real world. Unlike the full immersion of VR, AR allows users to view the outside world while interacting with digital content. In this study, the patient will interact with Magic Mallet (developed by Miney Moe) until falling asleep during the anesthesia induction process. Magic Mallet is a distraction game designed for pain management and communication during procedures. The game automatically adjusts cognitive load for optimal effect for users. Study team iPhones specifically loaded with Magic Mallet, and without cellular capability, will be used with the Mira Prism.",Oculus Go VR	Mira Prism VR,"""smartphone"""

Management of diabetes in these facilities is challenging due to number of older adults with higher prevalence of other diseases, functional disability, and altered nutritional intake, which increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugars).

Many Clinical guidelines recommend the use of insulin, as the preferred therapy for glycemic (sugar) control for most patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The use of insulin is effective in improving glycemic control, but associated with high rates of hypoglycemia in LTC residents with T2D. This high rate of hypoglycemia is concerning, because hypoglycemia has been associated with many complications and mortality.

The bedside capillary point of care (POC) glucose monitoring is the standard of care to assess glycemic control in the hospital and in LTC facilities. POC testing is usually performed before meals and at bedtime. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) measures glucose every 5-15 minutes, thus provides a more complete glycemic profile during 24-hours when compared to POC testing.

The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the use of Dexcom CGM with Glucose Telemetry System (CGM-GTS) with hypoglycemia alarm compared to standard of care using capillary POC testing, will facilitate diabetes treatment and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2D in LTC facilities.

Several studies indicate that current early intervention programs may not significantly alter long-term clinical outcome, suggesting that critical treatment target(s), beyond symptoms and functional status, are not being addressed. Evidence strongly indicates that, along with cognitive dysfunction, impaired motivation is also a critical target and unmet therapeutic need.

The application of effective treatment to improve cognition in early phases of psychosis has a very high likelihood of significantly improving long-term community functioning. The investigators have demonstrated both behavioral gains and improved neural system functioning after neuroscience-informed cognitive training in schizophrenia, in both chronic and early phases of the illness. In young recent-onset individuals (average age of 21 years), the investigators' multi-site double-blind randomized controlled trial showed that 40 hours/ 10 weeks of cognitive training delivered at home over a laptop resulted in significant gains in global cognition, verbal memory, and problem solving compared to a computer games control condition. Cognitive gains were significantly correlated with enhanced thalamic volume and thalamo-cortical connectivity, as well as increased white matter integrity. A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs in early schizophrenia has also indicated the benefit of cognitive remediation approaches.

Impaired motivation is also a core feature and very strong predictor of functional outcome in early stages of psychosis. Some studies have shown positive effects in improving motivation immediately after the intervention, but treatments that induce enduring improvements in motivated behavior are scarce. Disturbances in motivated behavior reflect a range of factors, including diminished anticipatory pleasure, difficulty learning from rewarding outcomes, reduction in effort expended to obtain rewarding outcomes, and impairment and disconnection between components of social motivation. This makes it difficult to determine optimal therapeutic approaches. However, some headway is starting to appear in the literature. For instance, social cognition impairments appear to play a specific contributing role to dysfunctions in motivated behavior, and are amenable to intervention. We have found that ratings of motivated behavior improve after social cognition training, and are significantly greater in subjects who performed cognitive training combined with social cognition training, than in those who completed only cognitive training. The investigators have also demonstrated a significant relationship between 6-month social functioning and training-induced improvements in the neural correlates of a self-other reality monitoring task. These data, along with the literature on reward anticipation and on social engagement in psychosis, led this group to work with young clients in a user-centered design process, to develop a mobile app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). The app has been extremely well received by users and published behavioral findings are highly promising. Thus, the investigators will combine a focused course of cognitive plus social cognitive training (delivered remotely) with PRIME, to address the cognitive dysfunction and impaired motivation.

Functional recovery lags behind symptom recovery in early intervention programs, is sometimes difficult for individuals to attain, and is closely aligned with cognitive and motivational deficits. How could outcomes for individuals with early psychosis to improved? The results from the EPI-MINN: Measurement-Based Care study will provide data-driven knowledge on factors that contribute to 2-year treatment response trajectories in early psychosis.

Annually, over 3.5 million predominantly young and healthy individuals undergo outpatient third molar ('wisdom tooth') tooth extractions and routinely receive postoperative opioid prescription (Moore, Nahouraii et al. 2006). This procedure is among the most prevalent instances of opioid prescriptions dispensed to adolescents and is the subject of a national debate, given the risk for persistent opioid use and abuse in a vulnerable population (Volkow, McLellan et al. 2011, Dowell, Haegerich et al. 2016, Groenewald, Rabbitts et al. 2016, Moore, Dionne et al. 2016, Harbaugh, Nalliah et al. 2018). The investigators believe that this overuse can be minimized by bringing about immediate and sustained pain relief following extractions and by proper monitoring to regulate post-operative opioid usage.

Prolonged mouth opening as well as eccentric and isometric contractions, as are typical during third molar tooth extraction procedures, can result in acute muscle pain in the masticatory or 'chewing' muscles. However, it is common practice to numb only the actual tooth extraction site for postoperative pain management, without evaluating for and addressing acute post-procedure muscle pain. The investigators' preliminary studies have corroborated the efficacy of the Twin block, a local anesthetic, in the diagnosis and management of acute and chronic myogenous orofacial pain stemming from the 'chewing muscles' (Quek, Young et al. 2014, Kanti, Ananthan et al. 2017). The investigators expect that administering the Twin block immediately following third molar extractions, will be an innovative and effective modality to alleviate acute post-procedure pain experienced by the patient and hence reduce the need for post-operative opioid pain medication. Our hypothesis, therefore, is that reduction in opioid prescription and unwarranted use can be achieved by a combination of Twin block and an actively monitored pill dispenser. We have selected the iPill Dispenser® to monitor and regulate post-operative usage.

The iPill device includes an App that utilizes biometric user authentication to operate a portable tamper-resistant, pre-calibrated device to regulate, deliver, and monitor opioid usage for pain, preventing overconsumption and diversion. Coencapsulating the pain pill with the IEM will create a virtual 'time-stamp' by triggering a wireless signal from the IEM, when contacted by stomach acid content, which is detected by a sensor secured on the skin with an adhesive strip.

Therefore, the Specific Aims are:

Specific Aim 1. Compare peak postoperative pain after third molar tooth extractions, with and without the twin block, in a randomized blind prospective clinical study Patients undergoing third molar tooth extractions under 'moderate' (intravenous) sedation, will be randomized to receive either the twin block or a sham injection on the side of their extraction/s. The Twin block and sham injection groups will be compared for peak postoperative pain measured using the numerical pain rating scale (NRS). The investigators predict at least a 50% reduction in percentage of patients reporting significant pain (NRS≥5), in the group randomized to receive the twin block.

Specific Aim 2. Compare postoperative opioid consumption during the first 96 hours following third molar tooth extractions between patients randomized to the control or twin block groups Using the iPill dispenser and app, the investigators will track IEM-co-encapsulated opioid consumption for severe pain among patients randomized to either the sham or Twin block arms. The investigators predict at least a 30% reduction in opioid consumption for severe pain in the group randomized to receive the Twin block. The investigators expect that utilizing the iPill dispenser® and app will enforce rigorous, real-time and accurate monitoring of opioid usage for pain management, overcoming the traditional reliance on patient-reported usage.

POSSIBLE OUTCOMES: This research will potentially transform conventional postoperative pain management following third molar ('wisdom' tooth) extractions. The investigators expect the routine incorporation of the twin block to alleviate post-operative pain, thereby reducing the current reliance on opioid prescriptions in a vulnerable population, especially after a commonplace procedure.",Yes,No,Drug	Device,"Reducing opioid prescription related use and misuse is a major focus for countering the national epidemic of opioid overdose and death.

This overuse can be minimized by bringing about immediate and sustained pain relief following extractions and by proper monitoring to regulate post-operative opioid usage.

The investigators developed the Twin block, a local anesthetic nerve block that rapidly eases pain from the 'closer' muscles of the jaw and showed its long-term effectiveness in patients with chronic jaw muscle pain. Administering the Twin block immediately following third molar extractions will be an innovative and effective modality to alleviate acute post-procedure pain experienced by the patient and hence reduce the need for post-operative opioid pain medication.

Background: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to reduce hypoglycemia in adults on insulin. The effectiveness of CGM in adults with type 2 diabetes not on insulin therapy has not been well studied. We hypothesize that isCGM linked to structured education - specifically one-on-one review and feedback of glucose values with a diabetes educator - can improve HbA1c via a combination of improved lifestyle choices and accelerated medication intensification, in adults with earlier T2DM. To test this hypothesis, we propose a randomized controlled trial of isCGM + structured education, versus enhanced usual care with structured education only.

Methods: Open-label, 12-week, single-center randomized controlled trial. Included adults will be randomized 1:1 to intervention or enhanced usual care. Intervention participants will receive two FreeStyle Libre 2 (Abbott Laboratories, IL) isCGM sensors to be applied over weeks 1-2 and 5-6.

Participants will be asked to complete patient-reported outcome instruments for secondary outcomes, e.g.: diabetes self-empowerment, diet, and physical activity.

Significance: This trial will examine the effectiveness of scheduled, intermittent use of isCGM sensors for type 2 diabetes, when combined with education and feedback.

Self-monitoring of glucose can help adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) progress towards their glucose targets. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), an alternative to traditional capillary blood glucose (CBG), uses a wearable sensor that continuously samples interstitial fluid glucose. Real-time CGM (rtCGM) continuously transmits blood glucose values, while intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) requires scanning of the sensor to obtain the readings. CGM is painless, provides information on glucose trends, and has consistently demonstrated improved patient satisfaction compared to CBG, which is limited by the inconvenience and discomfort of fingersticks.

Numerous approaches have been taken to stimulate people to maintain a more healthy diet, but results are highly variable across studies and subjects. One explanation for this is that in many approaches the individuals' specific needs and the context they live and work in are not sufficiently taken into account. For an approach to be more effective, personal characteristics need to be taken into account. In other words, the approach needs to be tailored or personalised. When focussing on personalized nutrition and health in the work environment, the aspects of health that are included in the study should also be relevant for the work environment. Three main parameters of interest are selected: (postprandial) blood glucose levels, cognition and (subjective) wellbeing.

Objective:

The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate the relationship between glucose and cognition and wellbeing, as well as food intake in an at-work setting.

Secondary objectives are :1) Does self-monitoring and feedback about food intake and health stimulate individuals to make healthier choices? 2) What are the user experiences of employees to perform self-monitoring of and receive feedback on, glucose, wellbeing and cognition in the workplace?

Study design:

This study will be designed as a randomized controlled trial with two groups, the feedback group and the control group. The study will consist of two self-monitoring periods of two weeks. In between these two self-monitoring periods, the participants in the feedback group will be given feedback on their measurement data. The control group will not get any feedback.

During each of these intervention visits, subjects will wear an Omnipod to deliver insulin and a Dexcom G5 CGM to measure glucose. In the dual-hormone closed-loop study, participants will wear a second Omnipod filled with XeriSol™ glucagon. The first day of intervention visit will be a 12 hour inpatient visit with the subsequent time spent as an outpatient. The subject will come back to the research center on Day 4 in the morning to remove all devices. The blood glucose control system is called the Artificial Pancreas Controller (APC). During one of the studies, glucose will be controlled using the dual hormone mode. During another study, glucose will be controlled using the single hormone mode. The single and dual hormone modes of the APC controller determine insulin only and insulin with glucagon delivery rates based on proportional and derivative error and contain an exercise detection component. During the other study, glucose will be controlled using a predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) mode. In the PLGS mode, the APC will be programmed with the subject's basal profile(s) which will be transmitted to the Omnipod Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM) and allow for boluses to be inputted by the subjects for meals and corrections using their typical carb ratios and correction factors. However, this system will have a safety feature to suspend insulin delivery when sensor glucose is predicted to go below a threshold. Treatment order will be randomized.

NSSI is the deliberate attempt to harm oneself, most often through cutting or burning, without suicidal intent. NSSI is a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy often triggered by negative emotions, especially those involving feelings of rejection. tDCS is a low-cost, portable, well-tolerated, non-invasive form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain via electrodes. Several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in treating an array of conditions, depending on electrode placement, including depression and chronic pain. tDCS may also facilitate adaptive emotion regulation; researchers have also successfully used tDCS to reduce negative emotions and aggressive responses to social rejection. The investigators therefore seek to explore tDCS as a potential treatment for NSSI. This pilot feasibility study seeks 1) to examine how at-home, self-administered tDCS is tolerated in a sample of individuals who engage in frequent NSSI; 2) to gather pilot data regarding changes in emotional and neural responses during a social task after a series of tDCS sessions in this clinical population of individuals who engage in NSSI; 3) to gather pilot data on the effects of tDCS on NSSI behaviors and urges.

Cardiothoracic surgery can be an extremely traumatic experience for the patient. Their chest wall muscles and tissues can be cut, crushing the intercostal nerves and irritating the pleura. During the perioperative period, over 16% of patients suffer from clinically significant anxiety, and up to 57% of patients experience stabbing and throbbing chest and shoulder pain that can persist for months to years.

Currently, perioperative pain is most often treated with opioids, and treatments for perioperative anxiety are limited and can have severe side-effects. Interventions using virtual reality may be a promising alternative to opioids and benzodiazepines in the treatment of perioperative pain and anxiety. Virtual Reality consists of immersing patients into a computer-generated environment and exposing users to visual and audio sensory inputs. Through visual and audio cues that modulate pain-related brain activity in the thalamus, VR can increase pain tolerance. Encouragingly, studies have demonstrated the ability of VR to decrease pain intensity and increase pain tolerance in patients suffering from chronic pain. In addition, olfactory stimuli play a crucial, yet distinct, role in pain perception and relaxation. The olfactory bulb projects directly and without thalamic relay to brain regions that are involved in the processing of emotion and pain. Studies have shown that there is significant overlap between brain regions activated by painful stimuli and olfactory stimuli. When an individual smells a pleasant scent, olfactory stimuli activate the amygdala and alter its connectivity and functional coupling with brain regions linked to pain perception.

There is potential for an intervention combining VR and OS to lead to a greater reduction in pain and anxiety. Pain and anxiety are characterized by multiple neural pathways. Pain results from the activation of a widely distributed brain network, including the thalamus, insular cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex. Anxiety results from a combination of neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, and neuroanatomical disruptions in the limbic system. Of note, studies have shown that although pain and anxiety have distinct neural pathways, anxiety modulates the perception of pain, and preoperative anxiety is associated with increased postoperative pain. However, current treatments for perioperative pain and anxiety are often ineffective because they only address one of the many pathways that contribute to pain and anxiety. As such, multimodal interventions are necessary to achieve optimal pain and anxiety control. Although OS and VR both reduce pain and anxiety, they have been shown to activate different regions of the brain. VR reduces pain and anxiety by directly modulating pain-related brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, decreasing pain intensity and increasing user's ability to tolerate pain. OS activates the limbic system, including the amygdala and hippocampus, reducing pain and anxiety by altering its connectivity and functional coupling with brain regions linked to pain perception.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a VR and OS multimodal intervention in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the preliminary effects of the VR/OS intervention on patient pain and anxiety before and after cardiothoracic surgery. This is a prospective, randomized study. A total of 80 patients are anticipated to participate in this study. All patients are expected to be enrolled at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to the VR/OS intervention or usual care approximately 2-4 weeks prior to their scheduled cardiothoracic operation.",Yes,No,Device	Device	Device,"Patients who undergo cardiothoracic surgery often experience pain and anxiety around the time of surgery. Currently, treatments for pain and anxiety around the time of surgery include opioids and benzodiazepines, which can have severe side effects and can be ineffective.

Within the capsule is a piezo electric transducer which allows us to control the release of scent via Bluetooth using a smartphone app. Each Essence Necklace will be paired with a google phone that the investigators will use to control the frequency and intensity of scent for each patient. The investigators will limit the frequency to one burst of scent every 20 seconds to avoid habituation. For the scent, the investigators will use diluted lavender essential oil (10% essential oil: 90% water). The investigators chose lavender because in our previous studies, >97% of users enjoyed the lavender scent. The Essence Necklace is powered with a 3.7V Lithium Battery and has a battery lifetime of approximately 6 hours. The RC can easily recharge the Essence Necklace through a USB micro connector. Additionally, the Essence Necklace can be easily sanitized and reused by multiple patients.	The bedside olfaction device can be clipped on to the side of the patient's bed or beside table.

During this session, the investigators will obtain informed consent, and then the participant will complete a balance test comprised of five, 20-second trials.

The testing procedures are as follows. All participants will perform the mBESS protocol as outlined by the Sway Balance Application. This protocol consists of a total of 5 balance trials, each being 20 seconds in duration. Every balance trial is completed with the eyes closed. Each trial has a different stance configuration: eyes closed feet together, eyes closed right tandem stance (one foot in front of the other, touching the toe to the heel), eyes closed left tandem stance, eyes closed right foot balance, eyes closed left foot balance.

During the test, the participant will hold an iPad mini to their torso, right in front of their sternum and follow the audio prompts to begin balancing and when the balance trial is over. The participant will be given instructions that they can change their stance if they lose their balance, and take a compensatory step if they need it to catch their balance. The participant will be standing on a Balance Tracking Systems force platform for each test, in order to capture an additional objective measurement of their balance. The participant will be asked to ensure they have at least one foot in contact with the plate during each trial.

If a participant should step off of the force platform during an individual trial, the participant will re-do that balance condition to ensure that each participant has one complete 20-second trial that has a score from the Sway app, as well as a full 20-second dataset from the force platform.

To improve tolerability and logistical burden, we have developed a novel design whereby participants will receive three doses of TBS on alternate days of the week. This design will allow us to assess efficacy while leveraging an accelerated treatment course (nine stimulation sessions per week). We have three specific aims:

Specific Aim 1. To determine the efficacy and safety of TBS for the treatment of post-traumatic headache among individuals who have sustained a mild TBI. Hypothesis 1a: TBS will be safe, well-tolerated, and reduce the number of headache days. Hypothesis 1b: TBS will improve function and quality of life outcomes.

Specific Aim 2: To determine the efficacy and safety of an accelerated time-course of TBS for the management of post-traumatic headache. Hypothesis 2a: The accelerated-time course will be safe, well-tolerated, and improve quality of life outcomes. Hypothesis 2b: The accelerated time-course will produce greater and faster improvement in headache symptoms than that reported in the literature for standard repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols.

Specific Aim 3: To examine the durability of treatment response to accelerated TBS during a one-month observational period. Hypothesis 3: Accelerated TBS will result in enduring treatment response of post-traumatic headache symptoms over the follow-up period.

Improving glycemic control has been shown to improve length of stay, multi-organ failure, systemic infections, as well as short- and long-term mortality. Clinical guidelines from professional organizations recommend the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical and surgical patients with T2D. This approach, however, is labor intensive requiring multiple daily insulin injections, costly, and associated with significant risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia

Over 75% of patients with T2D are treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) but due to the lack of safety and efficacy data from randomized controlled trials, clinical guidelines recommend stopping OADs during hospitalization. The current clinical guidelines have raised concerns with the use of OADs including risk of hypoglycemia with sulfonylureas, fluid retention and worsening of heart failure with thiazolidinediones, and risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis in patients with severe renal impairment. However, several observational studies have reported that the use of OADs results in similar glycemic control without increased risk of complications compared to insulin regimens. A recent observational study that included 17,325 hospitalized patients with T2D, found that patients treated with OADs had similar glycemic control without differences in complications and no increase in rates of hypoglycemia compared to those treated with insulin.

Evidence-based acute management options for children and adolescents presenting to the ED with acute attacks of migraine are limited. The current standard of care, which comprises a combination of a neuroleptic (metoclopramide) and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (ketorolac), has a low level of evidence and is administered through an intravenous (IV) cannula. However, at least half of children and adolescents presenting to the ED with acute attacks of migraine would prefer to avoid an IV, and these standard of care migraine interventions have substantial side effects and costs. The Nerivio remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device is a novel, non-invasive, wearable REN device that is applied to the arm using an armband and wirelessly controlled by a smartphone software application. REN has established efficacy and safety for the treatment of acute attacks of migraine in adults, and preliminary open-label efficacy and safety data for use in adolescents. Through user engagement efforts, the investigators have identified that children and adolescents with migraine and ED providers are interested in trying REN to treat refractory acute attacks in the ED.

The investigators are proposing a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will aim to determine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a phase III RCT, in which children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine will be randomized to REN, or to standard of care IV treatment in a double-dummy design. The objectives of the investigators are:

To determine the feasibility of comparing REN to the standard of care IV intervention (i.e., a combination of metoclopramide and ketorolac) for the treatment of children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine.
To determine the acceptability of the study design and of using REN to treat children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine.
To gather preliminary efficacy and safety data on the use of REN to treat children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine.

Children and adolescents with migraine often present to the emergency department (ED) with acute attacks, where migraine accounts for up to ~30% of all pediatric ED visits for headache. Based on the limited evidence, many centers have adopted protocols whereby children and adolescents who visit the ED with acute attacks of migraine are treated with an IV neuroleptic (metoclopramide or prochlorperazine) and an IV non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (ketorolac). This combination of interventions is largely considered to be standard of care despite no rigorous evidence to support this practice. Side effect rates with the neuroleptics (metoclopramide or prochlorperazine) are considerable, and IV catheters are associated with high adverse event and failure rates in children and adolescents. Therefore, the current standard of care for managing children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks of migraine poses concern to patients and is associated with significant pain and frequent side effects.

Emerging neuromodulation devices show promise for expanding acute treatment options. Over the past few years, there has been a growth in research investigating the efficacy and safety of non-invasive neuromodulation, which delivers electrical or magnetic stimulation to nerves or neural tissue, for the management of acute attacks of migraine. At present, there are 3 commercially available, non-invasive neuromodulation devices that effectively and safely treat acute attacks of migraine in adults. Because none of these devices have a high level evidence in children, adolescents, nor in the ED setting, there is clinical equipoise as to which device would be most appropriate to study for treating children and adolescents visiting the ED with acute attacks.

TMC-CP01 is designed specifically for pain management and is tailored for low back pain. The treatment utilizes virtual reality and biofeedback to train patients to auto-regulate themselves and improve their pain over time. By providing patients an accessible and effective alternative pain management tool, patients can avoid opioid use, dependency, and resulting complications due to opioids. TMC-CP01 uses virtual reality as a platform to enable and optimize biofeedback training and psychological exercises.

Virtual Reality, alone is a proven method for pain management both through distraction and through active pain control mechanisms. Due to its stimulating nature, VR has the power to claim the majority of a user's attention and distract them from other stimuli such as pain. Because it is so visually engaging, VR is a powerful tool for visualization, which can be used to optimize and enhance visualization of biofeedback. VR can also affect users' emotions and perception by providing a sense of presence and psychological engagement. With recent developments in portable head mounted display (HMD) technology, VR has become accessible to people on a much broader and more affordable scale and it represents an ideal platform to develop a non-invasive pain management tool for chronic pain. Biofeedback is at the heart of TMC-CP01 and is the main mechanism by which patients learn to control their physiology. By allowing patients to visualize their physiological processes, patients gain a greater mind-body awareness and can learn to auto-regulate physiological functions that previously seemed out of their control.",Yes,No,Device,"The program, called TMC-CP01, will use a combination of virtual reality, biofeedback, and psychological exercises to manage pain associated with Chronic Low Back Pain. Chronic pain affects an estimated 100 million Americans, around one-third of the U.S. population. One of the most prevalent conditions under chronic pain is Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP). About 27% of chronic pain patients experience CLBP. It is the leading cause of disability in the world and 31 million Americans suffer from CLBP. The most common analgesic tool for pain patients, especially for LBP patients, is opioids. However, opioid users are subject to drug tolerance and physical dependence, which decreases efficacy and increases risk of complication. Long-term users often require doses up to ten times their original dose to achieve equivalent analgesia and, after months of exposure, patients' risk of addiction increases.

Cognitive deficits are greatest among those with severe SCD genotypes, persistent anemia, and strokes and these deficits worsen over time.

Nearly everyone is affected by LBP at some moment in life (70-80% of lifetime prevalence). As a consequence, LBP is also presented as a leading cause of work absenteeism worldwide. Thus, although the estimate costs of LBP may be difficult to compare between different countries, its overwhelming socio-economic impact in modern society is evident.

In the absence of an effective treatment, LBP can become chronic, causing a huge impact in patients' daily life, and ultimately promoting a high consumption of healthcare resources. In the US alone, health expenditures for adults with spinal problems were estimated at $6000 per person, representing a total cost of $102 billion each year.

The dim picture described above highlights the urgent need for effective interventions that minimize disability, improve quality of life and decrease productivity losses.

Current guidelines on CLBP management recommend patient education, exercise, physical therapy (PT), and behavioural therapy as the mainstay treatments for this condition.

Despite some discrepancy in the type of exercise program (e.g. aquatic exercises, stretching, back schools, McKenzie exercise approach, yoga, tai-chi) and mode of delivery (e.g., individually designed programs, supervised home exercise, and group exercise), exercise therapy is recommended nearly transversally, with most studies concluding that exercise intervention programs should include a combination of muscular strength, flexibility and aerobic fitness exercises. Moreover, home exercises with a regular therapist follow-up has proven highly effective.

This is not, however, how LBP is currently managed. Appropriate patient education and structured behavioural training are rarely provided, and opioid prescription is also a common practice, despite known opioid-related morbidity and mortality rates. Because the prevalence of CLBP is continuously rising, and opioid misuse is an issue of great concern globally, identifying effective nonopioid alternatives for CLBP is of paramount importance.

Further compounding this problem, from the patients who are directed to PT, almost half give up after just 4 sessions, and only 30% complete their programs.

In this context, new ways of delivering care are much needed. Crucially, these need to: a) address the three pillars of care to achieve good and sustained clinical outcomes; b) overcome barriers to access; c) ensure patients are engaged throughout the programs; d) be scalable and cost-efficient.

Most relevant to this study, it is estimated that less than half of HIV-infected youth in the United States (US) have been diagnosed with HIV, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related deaths among youth have increased over the past decade despite decreased death rates among all other age groups, pointing to the urgent need for increased testing among youth.

Black and Latino youth are at increased risk of poor HIV-related outcomes and have disparate testing rates as compared to White youth. Mobile Health (mHealth) technology is a powerful and relevant tool which represents a promising approach for improving outcomes among youth living with HIV. Youth are avid adopters and heavy users of smartphones and digital technologies, and these technologies offer opportunities to tailor interventions to developmental stages and personal needs. Importantly, these technologies are capable of delivering interventions in real-time and in ecologic settings. This creates an opportunity to remotely reach youth through mobile and connected health approaches to strengthen their HIV care continuum engagement and treatment outcomes. In response, the investigators have developed the mLab App, an innovative mobile and connected technology that combines HIV prevention information with push notifications/reminders to complete HIV testing and an automated image processing feature to provide accessible, objective, secure, and real-time feedback on home-based OraQuick (lateral flow assay) HIV test results. The mLab App also contains an innovative automated data collection and a results reporting feature. Findings from the investigators' preliminary work in New York City indicate that youth perceive the mLab App as useful, easy to use, and effective at improving health outcomes and intend to use the technology. Furthermore, preliminary work in Africa support the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging algorithm for interpreting lateral flow assay results.

Despite evidence suggesting that behavioral interventions are efficacious, approximately 40-60% of adolescents receiving behavioral treatment show little to no improvement and skills are rarely generalized beyond treatment sessions. Lack of adolescent motivation and engagement, between-session skills use, reward saliency, and family involvement are key contributors to these limited effects. Mobile digital health (dHealth) strategies and gamification techniques, offer unique opportunities for overcoming the barriers of treatments specific to ADHD by using interactive tools to reinforce in-vivo skill practice, providing opportunities for immediate reinforcement, and motivating adolescents with digital rewards. The primary goal of this study is to develop and preliminarily test the integration of a digital health tool into organizational/behavioral skills treatment for adolescents with ADHD by improving executive functioning skills, providing in-vivo skills reinforcement, and monitoring adolescents' skill utilization.

This degradation has been loosely linked to behavior termed ""red-line"" events, such as alcohol abuse, suicide, and divorce, however there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation directly linking ""red-line"" behavior to physical and mental degradation. To address this issue, a program called Comprehensive Operator Readiness Assessment (cORA) was implemented for 3rd SFG(A) Green Beret warfighters at Fort Bragg as a holistic one- day physical and mental assessment to help identify and mitigate performance-degrading factors. However, due to the in-person nature of the cORA assessment, the scalability of the program is limited. Additionally, the current program only captures a snapshot of physical and mental status as all the data is collected on one day. In this study, we aim to perform a research study where we scale the cORA program by transforming it into a confidential, cybersecure research mobile application (app), called Digital cORA, that will digitize the existing measures of the program, as well as collect continuous measures of warfighter physical, neurocognitive (e.g. spatial memory, working memory), psychological, and lifestyle factors over a six-month period. In conjunction with data collected via the mobile app, wearable sensors will be used to collect physiologic (e.g. heart rate) and other data (e.g. activity, sleep), continuously during their approximately six-month study participation. In addition to collecting data, and similar to the in-person program, the app will have the capability of delivering helpful features, such as information and activities around nutrition, meditation and mindfulness features to best support warfighters, mitigate degradation, and optimize performance. The overall objective of the proposal is to investigate whether a digital version of the in-person cORA program can be created to reduce ""red-line"" behavioral events (e.g. injury, suicide, divorce, DUI, etc.) specifically, or overall warfighter degradation more generally, can be predicted from daily continuous measures of physical and mental behavior.

The research will allow collection of a comprehensive dataset of continuous physical and mental factors that can be tied to behavioral outcomes, particularly ""red-line"" events. We will analyze the data with traditional descriptive statistics to understand the structure of the data. We will then analyze the relationship between the various types of data and self-reported red-line events or general behavioral wellbeing/degradation using correlations and multiple regression analyses where appropriate.

Grounded in Jobes' Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS), Jaspr guides patients in completing a comprehensive suicide risk assessment and lethal means counseling, builds a crisis stabilization plan, and teaches behavioral skills to reduce imminent distress; videos of people with lived experience (PLE) offer wisdom and hope for getting through suicide crises. Information is summarized for the care team to aid in discharge disposition planning. Jaspr includes a companion app for home use to provide care transition support post-discharge. Results from a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=31) comparing it to Care-as-Usual (CAU) strongly support its feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness in increasing use of EBPs, reducing agitation and distress, improving capacity to cope with suicidal thoughts and improving ED satisfaction. Also, 100% of the 105 acutely suicidal ED patients who participated in all research phases recommended Jaspr for others in their situation. Jaspr's careful alignment with healthcare systems' (HCS) ED needs has led to rapid commercial adoption since completion of the RCT in 2020, with paid pilot tests in five EDs, and a contract to implement Jaspr in 13 EDs within a large Midwest HCS in 2021.

This 34-month fast track seeks to adapt Jaspr for primary care (Jaspr 2.0) and significantly expand its use to increase public health impact: (1) focus on those who are experiencing suicidal ideation only; (2) extend its utility to CAMS treatment; and (3) include an alcohol module when alcohol use disorder (AUD) is interfering with the ability to address and treat suicide drivers and/or is exacerbating the patient's primary problems. The CAMS approach will guide the integration of AUD EBPs. Investigators will design Jaspr for several primary care provider (PCP) use cases: serving as a real-time tool to guide PCPs in treating suicidal behaviors, as a treatment adjunct for patients to use on their own as ""homework"" in between PCP visits, and as a self-help tool for use during the care transition while waiting for mental health outpatient services.

Investigators will conduct a 12-week intent-to-treat RCT with 120 suicidal adults 18 years and older. Participants will again be recruited through Mayo Clinic and social media (to ensure sufficient participant flow, participant diversity, and participants with AUD). Participants will be randomly assigned to Jaspr2.0 (n=60) or an active control condition (n=60) including Virtual Hope Box, a well-regarded suicide prevention self-help app, plus an electronic wellness resources brochure containing links to health and wellness materials, psychoeducation about suicide, depression, self-help recovery-focused resources (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-Step programs, Moderation Management, etc.), and phone/text information for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Primary outcome variables include: suicidal behaviors (ideation, planning), self-efficacy and coping with suicidal thoughts and distress, and use of evidence-based strategies to cope with distress (behavioral skills, use of a crisis stability plan). Secondary outcome variables will include alcohol misuse and suicide attempts (considered secondary outcome due to the low base rate). App satisfaction and use of technology outcomes (i.e., degree of usage, features used) will be examined and reported descriptively.

Investigators hypothesize that in comparison to the active control condition, Jaspr2.0 participants will show significantly better outcomes from baseline to the 4, 8, and 12 week assessment points such that:

Jaspr participants will report significantly greater decreases in suicidal and alcohol misuse behaviors compared to study controls.

It has a lifetime prevalence of 1-3% and is considered 1 of the 10 most debilitating diseases by the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the most common types of OCD, affecting up to 46% of OCD patients, is characterized by severe contamination fears and excessive washing behaviors. These patients feel anxious even after incidents of minor ""contamination"" (for example, touching a door knob), and may spend up to several hours painstakingly washing and scrubbing their hands, sometimes causing bleeding and skin damage.

Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) treatment is often considered as a first-line intervention for contamination OCD in mild to moderate cases. It is a behavioral therapy with the strongest evidence that exposes patients to situations that provoke their obsessive thoughts while helping them cope with their compulsive rituals. Through repetitive ""exposure"" and ""response prevention,"" patients with contamination OCD can recognize that the dreaded outcome of their obsession is not likely.

Though ERP treatment may be the first-line and most effective psychotherapeutic intervention for contamination OCD, not everyone treated in this intervention show recovery. In fact, many patients fail to complete all of their ERP tasks such as engaging in the homework or ritual prevention techniques outside of the sessions. Therefore, there is an immediate need to encourage patients to engage ERP tasks between the therapy sessions and increase the retention rate of ERP treatment.

To address the unmet needs described above, the proposed intervention is intended to encourage patients to complete their ERP tasks at home and increase retention in outpatient ERP therapy programs. This study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of an ERP - based digital treatment for patients with contamination OCD.

The study will enroll up to 30 male or female subjects aged 18 years and older with a primary diagnosis of OCD based on the criteria. Subjects should have OCD with prominent contamination fears and obsessions as measured on the Padua Inventory Contamination Fear Subscale. Enrolled patients will receive ERP via OC Free for a 6-week treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period to measure preliminary effectiveness and safety.

The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the devices ability: (1) to record wireless EEG from patients in the long-term EEG monitoring unit (2) compare wireless EEG in these recordings to standard-of-care wired EEG (3) to record wireless EEG from patients undergoing ambulatory EEG monitoring (4) compare wireless EEG in these recordings to the ambulatory EEG findings (5) develop automated seizure detection algorithms based on the data collected herein (6) develop real-time seizure alerting based on the data collected herein (7) record longitudinal EEG from Epilog outside of the epilepsy monitoring unit while patients answer daily questions through a mobile app designed to provide a probability of the patient having a seizure event.

Hypotheses:

Single-channel EEG recorded with Epilog can be used to accurately detect seizures.
Single-channel EEG recorded with Epilog can be used to alert to seizures in real time.
Single-channel EEG recorded with Epilog can be used along with psychological, behavioral, and environmental input to a mobile app to create an hourly forecast of seizure probability.

Background:

Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) is a relatively expensive, time-consuming, inpatient monitoring procedure that can require several days to complete. It is designed to aid epileptologists in the diagnosis and localization of seizures and other abnormalities. EEG monitoring outside of the clinic is limited to bulky and cumbersome ambulatory monitoring systems that are prone to a variety of noise artifacts outside of the controlled confines of the long-term EEG monitoring (LTM) unit. An effective wireless EEG solution could improve long-term (continuous) EEG recordings. Importantly, long-term EEG monitoring outside of the hospital could yield important data regarding the general brain state, including seizure occurrence, in a realistic at-home setting. There is a clear need for a small, easy to use, reliable, wireless device for human EEG monitoring to aid in the treatment of a patients seizure disorder.

Patients are frequently referred to the long-term epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) in order to evaluate a suspect underlying neurological condition that may manifest through EEG and is a common procedure. Despite its clinical significance and the desire to minimize the time spent in the hospital, there is a gap in the ability to maintain a quantifiable report of EEG activity in the patients home environment. In general, patients diagnosed with a seizure disorder are asked to keep a seizure diary that is designed to aid the clinician in diagnosis. Patient self reporting of seizures with a seizure diary is often unreliable up to 55% of all seizures can be missed, and still others go misreported [1-3]. This is especially true of the developmentally delayed population where the burden of self-reporting seizures is often placed upon a care giver. Most seizures are non-convulsive and can be relatively subtle. It is extremely important for effective treatment to know how an anticonvulsant is affecting a patients seizures, particularly focal seizures. Often, seizures are amnesic and unless someone else recognizes the clinical signs of the seizure, it may go unnoticed[4]. Many seizures can occur at night or while a patient is sleepy or stressed [5-7] further making the detection of seizures difficult. Obtaining an accurate report of such unrecognizable seizures is difficult for persons with epilepsy and their families.

Early detection of acute electrographic seizures could lead to more-effective application of therapeutic approaches to block or minimize brain damage. Over 30% of patients with epilepsy have intractable seizures that are difficult to manage, are an immense financial burden to the person with epilepsy and their family, and drastically reduce quality of life [8, 9]. Thus, there remains a need to obtain quantifiable, continuous EEG records after a diagnosis of epilepsy. This study will allow the development of automated seizure detection, alerting, and prediction algorithms based on Epitel's Epilog single-channel, wireless EEG sensor.

This proposal will evaluate an individual-use, patch-type telemetry sensor for simplified, single-channel EEG recording from human patients. This sensor can be applied in a simple fashion to the scalp allowing real-time recording of the EEG signal on the sensor. This relatively small unit, roughly the size of a thick Band-Aid is self-contained, water resistant, and powered by a watch battery. The sensor is compact and would be applied and/or shown how to use during a clinical visit. The sensor is noninvasive and is attached to the patient by external placement on intact skin below hairline with a one-piece, one-day-use disposable conductive-adhesive sticker.

Research Design and Methods:

Study design:

This is both a prospective, un-blinded, observational study as well as a prospective un-blinded interventional study.

For the inpatient unit, the findings of standard wired EEG will be compared to the findings of wireless EEG recording device to develop a training dataset for machine learning algorithms for automated seizure detection.

For the outpatient unit, the characteristics of the EEG recorded with be combined with psychological, behavioral, and environmental input by the patient in a mobile app that then provides an hourly probability (percent change) of having a seizure in the next hour.

Study population:

The proposed patient population for this study involves pediatric patients, ages 5-17. The consideration of the pediatric population as a vulnerable population for participation in this study has been taken into account in determining the appropriateness of this protocol. This study will specifically provide information as to the specific needs of the pediatric patient population; which is anticipated to be a significant percentage of the user population of the proposed device. The risk assessment of the study anticipates that the pediatric subject population will not be exposed to risks greater than the current standard of care for which they are already being evaluated.

Subject Selection:

Inclusion Criteria for inpatient and outpatient unit:

Previous diagnosis of Epilepsy or other seizure disorder admitted for scheduled EEG testing, 5 to 17 years of age, inclusive

Exclusion criteria for the inpatient and outpatient unit:

Known or suspected allergy to adhesives

Study methods:

Up to four Epilog single-channel EEG sensors will be placed alongside gold-standard wired EEG in the epilepsy monitoring unit. Each sensor (1"" x 1"" x 1/4"", 6.6 g) is attached to the scalp below hairline with a one-piece conductive adhesive sticker consisting of a hypoalergenic hydrocolloid and hydrogel. Sensors are placed in roughly the F7, F8, TP9, or TP10 electrode locations in the international 10-10 system. Epilog is constructed of a circuit board with built-in gold EEG recording electrodes attached to both ends. The sensors are then be sealed and packaged in the form of a pliable medical-grade silicone, and be designed to have a low profile, such that it will not be easily dislodged or be uncomfortable to the user. The wireless EEG device is powered by a single lithium watch battery (CR2016, 270mW) sealed within the sensor to IPX3. The Epilog sensors only use batteries approved to IEC-60086-4. Epilog transmits EEG through secure Bluetooth when interacting with the mobile app. Otherwise, Epilog is capable of storing 10 consecutive days of EEG when the Bluetooth radio is disabled.

Once activated, the sensor begins transmitting and/or data logging the signal. The clinician can connect the device to the USB port of an HIPAA-approved, password protected laptop or other computer device for activating the sensor and/or imputing patient study ID information in the sensor and/or downloaded data off of the sensor according to the European Data Format, an internationally recognized standard EEG format (www.edfplus.info). In order to visualize the EEG signal in real time, a specifically-designed, mobile app can be used when Bluetooth is enabled on each sensor. For outpatient use, the ability to view EEG is disabled. Data can be downloaded from the device by connecting to an USB-enabled, password-protected computer. An USB-based acquisition hardware, computer, and software with an EDF-file viewer will be used for viewing, analyzing, and storing of EEG data according to HIPAA patient privacy policies.

Device information:

Labeling:

All investigational devices will have the following label statement: CAUTION Investigational Device. Limited by Federal law to investigational use.

Each sensor will also be labeled with the manufacturer, business location, quantity of contents and for identification and traceability, by serial number and date of manufacture.

Classification of the sensor:

This sensor is suitably similar to FDA-cleared, electroencephalography devices under section number 21 CFR 882.1400, identified as a device used to measure and record electrical activity of the patients brain obtained by placing two or more electrodes on the head. This sensor is subject to FDA Class II performance standards. This sensor route-to-market is through 510(k) clearance by demonstration of substantial equivalence to a legally marketed predicate device.

Sensor Receipt:

Epitel will directly deliver sensors to the Principal Investigator, who will log them on the sensor accountability form in the Study Binder.

Sensor Storage: Sensors are singly housed in boxes marked with the sensor serial number and a label statement: CAUTION Investigational Device. Limited by Federal law to investigational use. Sensors will be kept under material control in the epilepsy monitoring unit prior to and after use. Sensors shall be stored at approximately room temperature, under ambient conditions. There are no other special storage requirements.

Sensor Dispensing: Sensors will be logged on a device accountability form in the Study Binder when they 1 are delivered to neurology, 2 are placed on a study patient, 3 data has been downloaded from the device, 4 device data has been erased, and 5 devices have been returned to and received by the Study Sponsor. This will be signed and dated by the study team.

Sensor Disposition: After use, the study team will return sensors to the storage box/cabinet after downloading the data. Data on the sensors will be erased and each sensor will be used once if in-patient and only on a single patient if out-patient. Sensors will then be returned to the Study Sponsor where they will be accounted for, destroyed, and properly disposed of.

Return or Destruction of Sensors: Following collection of the data and sensor inspection, used sensors stored at neurology with battery level below 1.4V will be returned to the Study Sponsor where they will be accounted for, destroyed, and properly disposed of.

Recruitment and consent process in inpatient and outpatient units:

General Consent Processes: Patients presenting to the EMU for standard-of-care procedures will be recruited for this study. The Study Coordinator also maintains the responsibility of contacting eligible patients physician to ask for permission to approach family and patient via email. If the physician grants permission, the Study Coordinator will approach and inform the patient/guardian of the opportunity to participate in this study. All participants will be required to participate in the consent/assent process. The patient and legal guardians will be walked through the informed consent and assent documents and will be given appropriate time to ask questions on the study.

Consent/assent process for all patients who meet the criteria for enrollment:

The study will be described verbally when the Study Coordinator approaches the patient and family and the description will also be written in the consent document. The patients will be given a chance to ask questions at any point during the enrollment process. Upon their agreement to participate in the study, they will be asked to sign the consent form and give verbal consent/assent. There are no external recruitment procedures for this study.

Study Procedures:

Screening process: Patients will be screened by the research staff prior to their hospital admission. The research staff team will review the weekly admission list and screen patients for enrollment appropriateness. Once an eligible patient is selected, the research team will call or email the patients asummary of the study and request approval to approach the patient for consent/assent when they are admitted.

Enrollment:

Once eligibility is determined and the research team receives approval to approach, the eligible patient and their family will be given a verbal description of the study by the research staff and offered a chance to participate in the study. The eligible patient and their family where appropriate, will be walked through the informed consent documents and will be given appropriate time to ask questions on the study. After informed consent to participate in the study is obtained, the patient will be enrolled. Patient enrollment may be performed by any of the study team members, as listed in the roles/responsibilities section. Patient enrollment is documented in the Study Binder.

Sensor Placement:

Patients will be monitored by the Epilog sensor(s) and full-montage wired EEG for patients who remain in the EMU. Sensors will be placed per the neurologists direction, next to a standard electrode in an area where seizures are known to occur in the event that epilepsy has been previously diagnosed or suspect to occur. Written documentation on the placement location(s) of each sensor alongside the standard wired EEG electrodes shall be recorded for each patient. Patients will wear Epilog for as long as wired EEG is simultaneously recorded (1-7 days in the EMU). For patients who are to wear Epilog continuously outside of the EMU, instructions will be provided in both written, a verbal interactive demonstration, as well as video of how to use Epilog and the mobile app.

After use, the Epilog sensors will be removed by gently peeling it off the scalp. For out-patient use, patients and their family/caregivers are instructed to replace the conductive-adhesive sticker once per day, typically while showering or bathing, or before bed.

Risks and Benefits:

Study Risks:

The risks of this study are minimal. There is a potential risk that the patient may have an adverse reaction to the conductive-adhesive gel used to fix the recording electrodes to the scalp. This risk will be minimized by observing the scalp around the device daily for redness or irritation that could indicate a reaction to the conductive-adhesive. Only FDA-clear hypoalergenic conductive hydrogel and adhesive hydrocolloids are used.

Study Benefits:

There are no direct benefits to the patient for taking part in this study. The potential benefit to clinics and patients longer term is that recording wireless EEG may prove useful for determining if a single channel of wireless, long-term EEG can be used to detect, alert, and predict seizure activity outside of the hospital during a patients everyday activities. The EEG may also be used to determine the prevalence of normal versus abnormal sleep cycling in patients, though this information will not be directly evaluated in this study.

Withdrawal:

Subject withdrawal: Subjects will exit the study if any of the following conditions exist; 1) Subject voluntarily withdraws from the study, 2) Subjects well-being, in the opinion of the Investigator would be compromised by study continuation, 3) Subject experiences an adverse event defined by the Investigator as device related.

How to withdraw subjects:

A subject may report their voluntary withdrawal to any of the contacts of the study. Any study team member receiving a notification of withdrawal shall report this to the Study Coordinator. If an Investigator withdraws a subject; this shall be documented in the Study Binder with the reason for withdrawal. If there were any adverse events related to the withdrawal, the Investigator and the Study Coordinator in their role as Safety Monitor are responsible for investigating, documenting and if applicable, reporting these incidents. The Study Coordinator and Principal Investigator of the study are responsible for ensuring the safety of the patient in the event of withdrawal and that all dispensed devices have been recovered. The withdrawal of any patient is documented in the Study Binder under participant information.

Safety:

There are no risks to the patient for premature withdrawal from this study.

Follow-up:

A reasonable effort shall be made to follow-up with all study participants who withdraw from the study after the time of withdrawal to ensure that there are no device related adverse events. Minimally, this effort should obtain survival data on the patient. The Study Coordinator is responsible for this follow-up.

Study Data:

Upon enrollment the following data will be collected as part of the study: sex, age, documentation of no known skin allergy/sensitivity to adhesives (exclusionary characteristic), history of epilepsy diagnosis (if applicable). During the Study, wireless EEG will be obtained from the study device. For in-patient, the EEG will be recorded by traditional wired procedure for the duration the study device is worn. For out-patient data, daily responses to ta set of survey questions presented to the patient by the Aura app, modified with PROMIS, developed by Dr. Madison Berl. Each person enrolled will answer baseline survey questions that include (1) average number of hours one sleeps per-day during a typical week, and (2) 10-question Perceived Stress Scale survey. Answers to these baseline questions will personalize risk associated with each change from baseline over time. As the out-patient study begins and enrollees wear Epilog for the 90 day period, the mobile app will continue to ask behavioral and psychological survey questions as a means to effect a change in the seizure forecast provided by the mobile app. The number of questions asked of the user by the app will not exceed four per day to reduce burden of using the app on a daily basis. Along with physiological parameters (EEG and circadian seizure susceptibility), an hourly seizure forecast will be estimated and optimized post hoc. This would be a forecast the user would see and could use to plan their day. Importantly, we will track how the user interacts with the mobile app to determine adherence, how often the app is used, clicks, crash statistics, and overall satisfaction. It may be the case where the patient enrolled begins to answer questions posed by the app infrequently or not at all. To mitigate this problem the app will continue to prompt the user to answer the questions if they are dismissed. If the user misses two or more days, the study coordinator will contact the patient to encourage adherence.

Analysis plan:

The primary outcome measures for this study are seizure event times marked by epileptologists as the start, end, artifacts, and seizure type during the in-patient studies. These data are used to develop the automated seizure detection and alerting algorithms. For out-patient studies, the patients' interaction with the mobile app, how often the app is used, clicks, crash statistics, and overall satisfaction with the seizure forecast probability performance.

Past studies estimate that up to 50% of these new infections originate from the approximately 20% of MSM who are unaware of their status. Expanded HIV testing can produce reductions in incidence when implemented on a broad scale by facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment. Rates of HIV testing are particularly low among AA and H/L MSM, and innovative approaches to encourage testing may help address high incidence in these men. Home-based, self-testing (HBST) for HIV offers considerable promise for increasing the number of MSM who are aware of their status by overcoming key barriers to clinic-based testing, such as inconvenience and confidentiality concerns. HBST may also be particularly well-suited for AA and H/L MSM, given that stigma and mistrust of medical care contribute to low testing rates. Despite its promise, however, many are concerned that HBST does not sufficiently connect users with critical post-testing resources, such as confirmatory testing and care among those who test positive, and that these limitations may result in delayed linkage to care. Existing, FDA-approved HBST kits provide a free, 24-hour helpline that offers these services to those who seek it, but few users do, and this ""passive"" approach may miss critical opportunities to engage with MSM for further prevention services.

To address these challenges, the investigators developed a mobile health platform (""eTEST"") that uses internet-of-things (IoT) technologies to monitor when HBST users open their tests in real time, allowing the investigators to provide timely, ""active"" follow-up counseling and referral over the phone after they do so. In a pilot study, the investigators show that providing HBST by mail at regular intervals boosted rates of any/repeat HIV testing among high-risk MSM compared with clinic-based testing reminders. Moreover, those who received follow-up phone counseling after HBST were more likely to receive risk reduction counseling, to consult with a medical provider about PrEP, and to initiate PrEP. Given these promising results, the proposed research will conduct a fully-powered efficacy trial of this approach in areas with large populations of AA and H/L MSM and high HIV incidence: Jackson, MS, Los Angeles, CA, and Boston, MA. High-risk MSM who have not tested for HIV in the last year will be recruited from MSM-oriented ""hook-up"" mobile apps, and assigned to receive either (1) HBST with post-test phone counseling/referral (""eTEST"" condition), (2) ""standard"" HBST without active follow-up, or (3) reminders to get tested for HIV at a local clinic (""control"" condition) at three month intervals over the course of 12 months.

Many young patients suffer from both intentional and non-intentional non-adherence, thus an appropriate intervention must address both types.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), when used as a stand-alone intervention, improves muscle strength and muscle mass in non-cancer patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure. The use of NMES to combat disuse atrophy and functional decline may be particularly useful in the HCT setting as patients undergo intensive preparatory chemotherapy and often experience symptoms including severe fatigue that leave them inactive or isolated for extended time periods surrounding the transplant. However, its use in the setting of cancer has not been well-established. This proposal will contribute to developing strategies toward optimizing the safety and outcomes associated with HCT in Veterans with hematologic malignancies. The overall goals of this study are to assess 1) the efficacy of an NMES vs Sham intervention on HCT-induced reductions in physical function and muscle mass and worsening of patient-reported fatigue and QOL and 2) the association between physical function and prolonged recovery of patient-reported fatigue and QOL. The investigators hypothesize that 1) NMES will attenuate the acute HCT-induced negative impact on physical function, body composition, QOL, and fatigue compared to Sham intervention, and 2) baseline physical function will be a significant predictor of 6-month recovery of patient-reported fatigue and QOL.

Physical function, body composition, QOL, and fatigue will be assessed at baseline (Pre, after admission to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit but before initiation of preparatory chemotherapy) and 28 plus or minus 5 days after HCT (Follow-up 1; FU1). The primary outcome will be between-group difference in 6MWT change at FU1 compared to Pre (N=23/group; 46 total). Secondary outcomes include: body composition measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; previously validated questionnaires (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue; Muscle and Joint Measures) to assess patient-reported fatigue, QOL, symptom burden, and functional status; standard of care clinical/laboratory data regarding co-morbidities, adverse events, hospitalizations, treatment history, functional status, and clinical course; and NMES process measures such as feasibility, acceptability, adherence in number of sessions, accurate use, duration/intensity, complications, and satisfaction. Aim 2: To determine predictive ability of baseline 6MWT on delayed recovery of physical function, QOL, and fatigue, patient-reported outcomes, physical function, and chart review will be collected 6-months after HCT (FU2). 6MWT at Pre will be used to determine significant predictors of QOL and fatigue at FU2 (N=46) as assessed by previously validated questionnaires. Clinical measures extracted from medical charts will include changes from FU1 to FU2 in standard of care clinical/laboratory data regarding co-morbidities, adverse events, hospitalizations, functional status, treatment history, disease trajectory, and survival. Aim 3 (exploratory): To investigate the acute impact of NMES vs. Sham during HCT on various aspects of physical function and patient-reported QOL for determining potential endpoints for future clinical trials. Exploratory measures of function (stair climbing power; muscle strength; sit-to-stand; handgrip strength; peak oxygen consumption) assessed at Pre and FU1 will be used to determine significant predictors of exploratory QOL measures (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory; Short Form-36; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire) assessed at FU2.",Yes,No,Device,"Some blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic (hematologic) cancers such as Hodgkin/Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma, are over-represented in Veterans due to exposures including Agent Orange and an increased percentage of patients of African American ethnicity.

Despite the significance of these symptoms, there are no approved treatments to prevent/reverse these long-term effects. The cancer itself, side effects of chemotherapy, and sedentary behavior, contribute to these effects.

It consists of a mobile application, which had an intake questionnaire, guides users to one of three anti-snoring solutions; a nasal dilator called, Mute (Rhinomed, Australia), a mandibular advancement device called myTAP V (Airway Management, Austin, TX) and a Sleep Positional Trainer SPT (SPT) (NightBalance, Netherlands). The Silent Night app also records snoring through the night and provides feedback to the user via a ""snore score.""

The objective of this trial is twofold. First, each of the interventions to be studied are known to be effective for snoring cessation. However, each is not fully effective in the total population. Their effectiveness is predicated on how an individual snores and where the snore anatomically originates. I.e. if someone position ally snores because their tongue moves back in their mouth, it is unlikely a nasal dilator will work for that individual. In order to improve the SilentNight recommendation algorithm more information needs to be gathered. By asking a battery of questions of a snorer, and having them trial all three snoring solutions it may be possible to understand the comparative effectiveness of each solution, the user acceptance of each solution and which questions should be used to discern what solution will work best for a given individual.

The second objective is to collect ""in the wild"" audio of snoring. The goal of this data collection, is to identify unique characteristics in the sound recording. These paired with the answers to the intake questions, and the relative effectiveness of the three anti-snoring solutions could phenotype the snore and snorer. This audio data could also be used to develop or refine a ""snore score"", a semi-objective assessment of snoring audio.

To accomplish these goals, a feasibility, crossover, in home study will be conducted. Up to 30 couples will be recruited to try each of the anti-snoring solutions over an approximately 5 week period. The participant couples will consist of a snorer and a bed partner. The snorer will use the three solutions (1 week for Mute, 2 weeks for myTAP and SPT) and give feedback on the devices, and sleep quality. The bed partner will also provide feedback on their sleep quality, the loudness of snoring and their perception of the device (as a non-user). They will also record bedroom sound during each night of the trial, including a baseline period where no snoring will take place. Each morning the bed partner will rate the snoring severity.

The primary endpoint will be the daily rating of snoring severity as rated by the bed partner. The daily responses will be averaged on a weekly basis. Due to titration and acclimation during the first 9 nights of use nights 10-14 of myTAP V and SPT use will be compared to the week of Mute use. If formal statistical comparisons are performed, continuous data will be compared between the three therapies using repeated-measures ANOVA or the non-parametric Friedman Test, depending on the distributions of the endpoints.

Aim 2: Can a machine learning algorithm derived from simultaneous phono- and electrocardiogram recordings reliably diagnose clinically important mitral regurgitation?

Significance Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a common global health problem, with population-based studies showing a prevalence of 10% for aortic stenosis (AS) and 20% for mitral regurgitation (MR). New surgical and interventional advances allow for the treatment of patients at an older age or whose risk of intervention would previously have been untenable. Given that the incidence of both MR and AS increases with increasing age, there is a growing need to identify these conditions so as to offer disease-altering therapies.

In current clinical practice, the diagnosis of VHD relies heavily on echocardiography. This, in turn, requires both a referral from a provider with a clinical suspicion for VHD, typically from an abnormality on auscultation, as well as access to the echocardiogram itself. MR and AS both result in reliably reproducible auscultatory findings: holosystolic and systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmurs, respectively. Yet despite this, auscultation as a diagnostic tool is notoriously poor: its accuracy to detect MR and AS ranges only from 5-40%. These factors all lead to concerns for underdiagnosis of these increasingly treatable conditions.

Here, the investigators will address the needs for both greater access to and improved diagnostic accuracy of testing for VHD. The investigators will utilize a combination of phonocardiogram (PCG) and single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, synced in real-time to a secure cloud-based server, using the Eko Duo electronic stethoscope. With these data, the investigators will develop and validate a machine learning algorithm to diagnose clinically important AS or MR. As the Eko Duo is essentially similar to a traditional stethoscope, an iconic tool widely accepted by patients and providers alike, its use to drive an automated detection algorithm is both feasible and attractive as a substitute for traditional auscultation. Furthermore, by shifting the burden of test interpretation away from the clinician and onto the algorithm, the investigators hypothesize that this will improve overall diagnostic accuracy.

Methods Overview of design: Cross-sectional study of all subjects undergoing clinical echocardiograms at the UCSF adult echocardiography laboratory

Study subjects Overview: The investigators will enroll adult subjects undergoing clinical echocardiograms at the UCSF Parnassus campus. These subjects will be grouped into derivation and validation cohorts sequentially, stratified by case status, so as to reach the expected sample size. Such grouping will occur after subject enrollment and data collection.

Target Population: Adults with either moderate-to-severe to severe AS or moderate-to-severe to severe MR (cases) and adults with structurally normal hearts with minimal VHD (controls). In a more-stringent, parallel analysis, a target population of controls will be defined as having any degree of AS or MR less than moderate-to-severe.

Accessible Population: Adults meeting the entry criteria undergoing clinical echocardiograms at the UCSF echocardiography laboratory amenable to participation.

Sampling Scheme: The investigators will approach subjects presenting to the adult echocardiography laboratory at UCSF Parnassus consecutively. Additionally, the investigators will pre-screen subjects for a high likelihood of having AS or MR (based on indication for study and prior diagnoses in the APEX medical record) and selectively target their enrollment during situations where the enrollment capacity of the study coordinator is saturated.

Recruitment Strategy: Introduction of study at time of registering for echocardiogram with a brochure or flyer, followed by in-person approaching of potential subjects while awaiting the clinical echocardiogram.

Retention Strategy: None. The investigators will retain a master file of the medical record numbers to identify contact information in the future if deemed necessary.

Measurements Overview: The study will focus on two measurements: 1) the gold standard assessment of VHD by echocardiogram, as reported by the UCSF echocardiography laboratory. 2) 30 second simultaneous PCG and single-lead ECG recordings by the Eko Duo device at each of the four standard cardiac auscultatory positions, with optional additional recordings with the Eko Core device. The study takes advantage of the fact that all clinical echocardiogram reports include these valvular assessments.

Gold Standard: The echocardiogram is accepted as the gold standard for diagnosis of VHD severity by the cardiology community. To minimize the burden on the investigators, as well as reduce costs, the investigators will take advantage of that all clinical echocardiogram reports include assessments of VHD, which will serve as the gold standard. These reports follow American Society for Echocardiography (ASE) guidelines, which allow grading of VHD as follows: none, mild, moderate, or severe. The UCSF echocardiography laboratory includes additional categories of trace, mild-to-moderate, moderate-to-severe, and critical, allowing for interpretations where individual parameters within the study conflict. The primary measurement will be the final conclusion of severity of VHD for MR or AS, as reported by a board-certified cardiologist. The investigators will define ""clinically important"" VHD as that graded moderate-to-severe or worse, as this would encompass all levels of disease which could require direct intervention. In addition, the investigators will extract the entire echocardiography report, as well as the images of the echocardiogram files, so as to save the data for future use as new research questions arise.

Device Measurements: Recordings of the simultaneous PCG and single-lead ECG will be performed for each subject in a standardized manner. Each subject will undergo 30 second recordings using the Eko Duo device at the four standard auscultation positions. Observers will be trained on the systematic method of obtaining measurements. Time and patient permitting, the investigators will also obtain the same recordings using the Eko Core device, which uses the same software but does not include ECG recording. As the device will allow visualization of the PCG during recording, the observer will get real-time feedback on positioning of the device to maximize the quality of the recording at each position. The investigators will plan for periodic review of recordings to ensure adequate data quality. The investigators anticipate that this flexibility and real-time feedback will improve the generalizability of the use of the device to a real-world (i.e. non-study) clinical situation.

Confounders and Bias: The derivation and validation of the algorithms will occur remotely, after the clinical echocardiogram has been performed, and therefore with no effect on the outcome of the gold standard. The test may be influenced by the presence of other conditions causing systolic murmurs (including VHD other than AS or MR, or congenital heart disease). The investigators will include these measures from the echocardiogram report to compare test performance in those with and without these other conditions.

Statistical issues Null Hypothesis: A machine learning algorithm cannot predict the presence of clinically important AS or MR.

Sample Size Justification:

Sensitivity of Algorithm: 90%
Specificity of Algorithm: 90%
Target Likelihood Ratio (+) of Algorithm [LR(R)]: 9 (derived from Sn / [1 - Sp])
Minimum Likelihood Ratio (+) of Algorithm [LR(R)]: 5
Confidence Level = 0.95 (alpha = 0.05)
Confidence Interval [LR(R)]: 5.120-15.820
Sample Size = 110 per group; 330 per cohort (control, AS case, MR case); 660 overall (training and validation cohorts)
Summary: Assuming the sensitivity and specificity of the machine learning algorithm for detection of clinically important AS or MR are both 0.9, a total sample size of 660 is not expected to go below the threshold likelihood ratio of 5.0 in the 95% confidence interval in either the derivation or validation cohorts.
Justification of Critical Assumptions: The investigators assume that the algorithm can produce a sensitivity and specificity of 90% in detecting aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation compared to hearts with no valvular disease, based upon prior published reports using neural networks, using sample sizes of under 100 cases. Furthermore, the investigators estimate a minimum likelihood ratio of 5 would be necessary for the test to be clinically useful. While this estimate works well for the validation set, the number needed for the derivation set is less clear; the estimates above are a conservative number. The investigators anticipate training the algorithm after enrollment of every 20 cases using a bootstrapping approach; this will provide interim test characteristics and help determine the true number needed for the derivation set. As this is, in part, a pilot study, identification of the true sensitivity and specificity of the test is in itself a valuable result.

Analysis approach: The investigators will generate ROC curves (plotting Sn vs. 1-Sp) for algorithm scores for the validation set. Ultimately the investigators will generate 4 curves: two each for MR and AS, using algorithms generated by the primary (defining controls as having no greater than mild VHD) and secondary (defining controls as not having moderate-to-severe or greater VHD) approaches. Additionally, the investigators anticipate performing exploratory, descriptive analyses of the algorithm itself, by identifying clinical correlates to the characteristics most heavily weighted in detecting AS or MR.

Miscellaneous Ethical considerations: No major concerns. Data will be securely stored on HIPAA compliant platforms. The study qualifies as minimal risk by UCSF CHR criteria.

Pretest plans: Prior to study recruitment, study staff will collect data on themselves and providers to test the data collection system. During initial subject recruitment, study staff will review the process after each day to discuss roadblocks or concerns.

Data Management Plan: Data from the study will come from two sources. Reports of echocardiograms, extracted from the electronic medical record (APEX), will be reviewed by study staff to generate the main database of disease characteristics. A master file linking subject identifiers with identifiable information, as well as extracted and de-identified echocardiogram reports and de-identified raw echocardiogram images will be stored on a secure research server used by the Division of Cardiology. Recorded PCG and ECG data (the actual study measurements) will be synced in real-time to a secure, HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based server managed by Eko Devices. At pre-specified times of algorithm training, the machine learning team (coordinated by Eko Devices) will be provided keys to the assignment of subject identifier to VHD category.

Quality control measures: Periodic review of the recorded data will be performed by the study PI to ensure appropriate data quality.

A familiar and inexpensive tool to assist in the diagnosis or exclusion of significant VHD could both expedite access to life-saving therapies and reduce the need for costly testing. The FDA-approved Eko Duo device consists of a digital stethoscope and a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), which wirelessly pairs with the Eko Mobile application to allow for simultaneous recording and visualization of phono- and electrocardiograms. These features uniquely situate this device to accumulate large sets of auscultatory data on patients both with and without VHD.

In this study, the investigators seek to develop an automated system to identify VHD by phono- and electrocardiogram. Specifically, the investigators will attempt to develop machine learning algorithms to learn the phonocardiograms of patients with clinically important aortic stenosis (AS) or mitral regurgitation (MR), and then task the algorithms to identify subjects with clinically important VHD, as identified by a gold standard, from naïve phonocardiograms.

An estimated blood loss (EBL) in excess of 500 mL following a vaginal birth has often been used for the definition of PPH, but the average volume of blood lost at delivery can approach these amounts when actually measured rather than estimated (2). More than half of all maternal deaths occur within 24 hours of delivery, most commonly from excessive bleeding (3). Worldwide, 140,000 women succumb to postpartum hemorrhage each year. The most common antecedents to postpartum hemorrhage are uterine atony, placental disorders, and trauma during delivery. Improving maternal health worldwide is one of the WHO's 8 Millennium Developmental Goals. The prevention and treatment of PPH is an essential step towards the achievement of that goal (4).

Estimates of blood loss at delivery are notoriously inaccurate, with under-estimation more common than over-estimation (5). Traditionally, the clinicians performing the vaginal delivery would estimate the blood loss by visually assessing the blood collected in the delivery drape drain and counting the number of lap sponges used thru out the delivery. Current detection and management of hemorrhage is heavily based on clinical judgment, which often leads to delay in recognition and intervention. Often, interventions such as fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion are not initiated until significant hemorrhage has already taken place. The traditional method for estimating blood loss is based on the clinician and nursing staff's subjective assessment that is severely limited by human error and the presence of large volumes of amniotic fluid (6).

Early detection and treatment of this potentially life-threatening obstetric complication is of utmost importance in the field of obstetrics. Simulations and didactic training have been shown to improve visual estimations, but there are still poor associations between experience level and accuracy, and a significant decay in blood loss estimation skills over time (7).

The Triton L&D system (Gauss Surgical, Inc., Menlo Park, CA) is an FDA-cleared mobile application on a tablet computer (iPad) that facilitates quantification of blood loss (QBL) by providing an easy to use process and user interface. Dry weights of all potential blood containing substrates are built-in to the device allowing batch weighing with automatic subtraction of dry weights. There is also a V-drape simulator accounting for collected fluids with automatic subtraction of a measured amount of amniotic fluid.

QBL is not regularly used at UTMB. Although widely recommended, little data is available to support its use in the obstetrical population. We believe that gathering further evidence regarding its value is appropriate.

Our hypothesis is that use of this device for QBL will enable clinicians to objectively measure blood loss in real-time.

This study uses an at-home intervention of tDCS and cognitive training and examines its potential usefulness at improving executive function in ALL survivors.

Investigators will use tDCS to apply a low electrical current to the participant's scalp in the area of the brain associated with fluent and flexible thinking. The current may make that area of the brain work better for a short period of time. During this time, the participant will play computer games designed to train the brain to work more fluently flexibly. Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to see if pairing the electrical stimulation with the brain games at home is a feasible method to improve cognitive abilities in long-term survivors of childhood ALL.

In the first part of this study, the short-term effect of tDCS intervention will be evaluated in the clinical setting using a randomized cross-over trial. The survivors will be randomized to receive either the tDCS intervention or Sham on day 1, with the other treatment given on day 2. Neurocognitive testing will be conducted within two hours of completing stimulation each day.

In the second part of this study, the feasibility and potential efficacy of self-administration of the tDCS intervention paired with cognitive training will be evaluated over 5 weeks. Research participants will be taught to use the mobile tDCS device and will be provided one to take home. The device will be programmed by the investigators in advance to control the intensity and duration of the stimulation. The research participants will use the device twice per week as directed.

Do not reside in Nigeria",2020-05-08,Observational,Acceptability and Performance of HIV Self-Testing in a Youth Population in Nigeria,,OTHER,OTHER_GOV	OTHER	NIH,"Nigerian youth aged 14-24 make up a significant proportion of Sub-Saharan African youth newly diagnosed with HIV. However, they do not access essential HIV prevention services, like routine HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing.This is partly explained by barriers that are individual (fear, and low perceived risk), social (insufficient social support) and structural (poor access to testing) factors. Additionally, the most affected groups of young people have remained largely unreached by traditional HIV testing services.

HIV self-testing (HIVST) can mitigate some of these barriers by decentralizing HIV testing,decreasing stigma, and linking HIV-negative individuals with preventive services. HIVST is a process in which a person collects his or her own specimen (oral fluid or blood) using a simple rapid HIV test and then performs the test and interprets the result, often in a private setting, either alone or with someone he or she trusts. HIVST offers an alternative to facility-based HIV testing services, particularly for youth populations who may fear to get tested for HIV due to stigma and discrimination. Recognizing the expanding evidence supporting the effectiveness of HIVST, particularly the OraQuick HIV self-testing kits (see Tun et al, 2018; Nagendo et al., 2017; Kurth et al., 2016; Choko et al., 2016; and WHO pre-qualification report under the Publications Tab), the World Health Organization released HIVST guidelines in 2016.

This study is in part with a parent study called ITEST (Innovative Tools to Expand HIV Self-Testing) aimed at developing and implementing innovative youth-friendly HIV self-testing services through open challenges and apprenticeships that provides youth opportunities to learn about social problems (like HIV) that affect their lives and then propose actions to address these problems, informed by the youth participatory action research framework (YPAR).

Recent study conducted in Nigeria, already demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of HIVST among 257 men sleeping with men (MSMs) in Nigeria (see paper by Tun, 2018). In that study, 97% reported using the HIVST kits. Almost all participants reported that the HIVST kit instructions were easy or somewhat easy to understand (99.6%) and perform the test (98.0%).The most common reasons they liked the test were ease of use (87.3%), confidentiality/privacy (82.1%), convenience (74.1%) and absence of needle pricks (64.9%).

However given the need for youth friendly HIV testing services that are accessible, acceptable, appropriate and effective to address the specialized needs of young people and the public health implications of unknown HIV status, especially among young people, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and performance of directly assisted oral HIVST in a youth population in Nigeria.

Given that oral HIV self-testing is a new testing approach in Nigeria, there is a strong need for more research to be done to provide evidence of its acceptability in the general population. Currently, there has been one completed study that assessed the feasibility and acceptability of HIVST; however, this was conducted among a sub-population group (Men who have sex with Men) [Tun et. al., 2018]. Thus, this study seeks to examine in a general population of adolescents and young people, the acceptability and performance of oral HIV self-testing and the factors that influence acceptability.

Study Procedures:

Study participants will be recruited from a health facility in Nigeria as well as from local college campuses and other youth-friendly community settings in Nigeria. At the health facilities, study flyers with mobile phone contact numbers will be used to recruit participants along with provider word of mouth. At the schools and college campuses, and community settings, research assistants will introduce the study and participants between the ages of 14-24 will be invited to participate in the study. All participants recruited at the health facility, schools, college campuses, and community settings will be given written informed consent.
Following informed consent, study staff will administer a pre-HIV testing questionnaire to collect basic demographic information and assess HIV test history, sexual behavior history, HIV self-testing knowledge, importance, confidence, and concerns with performing the test. Respondents will be given a tablet computer-assisted survey instrument (CASI) due to the sensitive nature of some of questions by NIMR research assistant and are able to enter their responses themselves. This is thought to increase the validity of responses, as respondents are more likely to give truthful answers.
Next, instructions on how to perform the oral HIVST using OraQuick Rapid HIV 1⁄2 Antibody, (OraSure Technologies), a rapid oral fluid test kit approved by FDA to detect HIV antibodies, will be given in person to each participant by the research assistant. The research assistant will show a short professionally developed video to introduce the concept of HIVST. The use of the video will allow us to standardize information provided to participants and limit discrepancies in the content and quality of the information provided. Pictorial information on how to perform the test will also be provided to participants. Instructions on how to perform the test will be repeated if asked by participants.
Next, participants perform the oral HIVST in the privacy of a separate room or mobile tent-set up. After completion of the test, participants take a photograph of their test results. The photographs of the test result will be taken using a study issued tablet. To login to the tablet, each participant will be provided with a unique login number which corresponds to the ID on their pre and post test. By using the photo verification component, we seek to examine whether they can correctly perform the test on their own and interpret the result, as intended. The trained research assistant will record the results as captured in the photo.
Next the trained research assistant from our partner organization, the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), will perform a confirmatory finger prick HIV test according to the national standards using the Determine and Uni-Gold in parallel as per the Nigerian HIV testing country guidelines. In a case where a participant test positive for HIV using the the HIVST kit, confirmatory testing will be available to the participant at the same location immediately.
Finally, study participants will complete a post-test questionnaire to capture perceived acceptability of HIVST and whether they had any problems performing oral HIVST. Respondents will complete survey on a tablet computer-assisted survey instrument (CASI) due to the sensitive nature of some of questions by NIMR research assistant and are able to enter their responses themselves.

We will adhere to the WHO five key components-the ""5 Cs""-that must be respected and adhered to by all HIV Testing services. These components are: Consent Confidentiality Counselling Correct test results Connection/linkage to prevention, care and treatment.

The five Cs, and the key principles they entail include the following:

People being tested for HIV must give informed consent to be tested. They must be informed of the process for HTC, the services that will be available depending on the results, and their right to refuse testing. Mandatory or compulsory (coerced) testing is never appropriate, regardless of where that coercion comes from: health-care providers, partners, family members, employers, or others.
Testing services must be confidential, meaning that the content of discussions between the person tested and the health-care worker, testing provider, or counselor, as well as the test results, will not be disclosed to anyone else without the consent of the person tested.
Testing services must be accompanied by appropriate and high-quality pre-test information or pre-test counselling, and post-test counselling. Given that the confirmatory testing will be administered immediately at the testing site, our partners NIMR, a PEPFAR supported site will provide pre- and post-test counseling following regulations in Nigeria. NIMR is a PEPFAR Support HIV Care Services in Lagos, Nigeria providing care since 2003 for over 24,000 individuals living with HIV in Lagos, Nigeria.
Provision of correct test results. Testing must be performed and quality assurance measures followed according to internationally-recognized testing strategies, norms, and standards based on the type of epidemic. Results must be communicated to the person tested unless that person refuses the results.

Recent research estimates that NCDs could cost the Indian economy US$6.2 trillion from 2012-2030 if left unaddressed. For some NCDs, new solutions will need to be developed for diagnosis and treatment, while, for others, the necessary interventions exist but are not readily available to all who need them. Visual impairment is one area of health in which limited access to diagnostic and treatment technologies jeopardizes the health and economic well-being of the population. This is particularly true in India, where the population is rapidly aging and, despite the presence of some high-quality medical facilities, there remains a large burden of unaddressed visual impairment.

Loss of visual acuity can negatively impact individual and household income by reducing productivity or hours worked among the visually impaired; it can also affect economic wellbeing via the need for caretakers. There are two key tests that determine visual acuity and measure vision loss:

Basic visual acuity (BVA), which is assessed using the naked eye or, when applicable, eyeglasses, and
Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), which uses refraction to determine eyeglass/contact lens prescription.

In addition, diagnosing vision-hindering eye conditions requires specific medications or surgical procedures. Diagnosis of glaucoma, cataracts, or diabetic retinopathy typically requires a physician to examine a patient's retinas, corneas, and/or pupils at close range using specialized equipment, in conjunction with the visual acuity tests described above.

BCVA tests typically require heavy, cumbersome, and expensive equipment such as phoropters (instruments that measure the refractive state of the eye). Likewise, eye diseases typically require the use of specialized equipment such as slit lamp microscopes, ophthalmoscopes, and tonometers.

However, the recent and anticipated availability of affordable and lightweight portable technologies which can be used both by medical professionals and by trained laypeople has made eye testing easier and faster. This study will validate a number of new handheld devices developed for visual acuity measurement and retinal imaging.

This study explores testing for visual acuity and other impairments like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and cataract without the use of traditional stationery and expensive instruments such as phoropters and conventional autorefractors and at a comparatively low cost. If the devices are proven able to accurately evaluate visual acuity and produce high-quality retinal images that can be used to aid diagnosis, it will be a breakthrough in reducing barriers of access to eye care facilities encountered by the majority of the rural population in India and other developing countries.

Also, since these devices are convenient and relatively easy to use, they can be easily used in household/community surveys involving vision measurement; the investigators are proposing to perform data collection for this study in India partially in order to investigate the potential for use of one or more of handheld devices in upcoming waves of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (Protocol Number 16715), a nationally-representative aging and retirement study that collects data on multiple dimensions of aging, including socioeconomic, cognitive, and health indicators with the aim of informing national policy and practice relating to older adults. Specifically, the study involves an extensive biomarkers module which includes direct measurement of multiple medical and anthropometric indicators, such as blood pressure, grip strength, lung function, height, and weight. The current version of the biomarkers module calls for the use of a traditional eye chart to measure BVA; however, future versions of the study would greatly benefit from the use, if feasible, of portable and inexpensive devices which would allow researchers to collect richer and more accurate data on visual acuity and/or eye conditions and therefore provide a more detailed picture on older adults' eye health, as well as the predictors and correlates of eye health, on a national level.

Through the data gained from this study, the investigators hope to be able to develop useful recommendations for researchers, community health organizations, and health care professionals whose studies and patients would benefit from access to relatively low-cost portable vision measurement and retinal imaging devices.

Existing measures of ART adherence such as self-report, pill counts, electronic pill-bottle caps, and prescription refills, provide only inferred measures of actual drug intake and most offer no real-time notification capability. Directly observed therapy measures actual drug intake but is not practical. These limitations constrain research into medication adherence and more importantly, limit our ability to develop real-time interventions based on feasible, in vivo monitoring of adherence among HIV-infected people to facilitate medication-taking. The Proteus digital health feedback (PDHF) system, a pill ingestible sensor based adherence measuring and monitoring system developed by Proteus Digital Health, addresses these limitations. It involves use of an ingestible sensor, a tiny edible material that is over-encapsulated along with prescribed medication. The sensor is activated by ingestion and is sensed by a patch worn by the patient with an embedded monitor and sensor. The monitor sends a Bluetooth signal to a mobile device, which in turn sends an encrypted message to a central server, thus effecting real-time monitoring that a dose has been taken. The investigators propose to develop a data receiving hub and add to these components an automated text message that is sent to the patient when a dose is missed.

HA adoption rates are even lower for people with lower income and for racial and ethnic minorities. Although the answer to why so few older adults seek or use amplification is multidimensional, one common thread is that many people believe that HAs fitted using the audiologist-based model cost too much. Therefore, it is not surprising that there has been increased advocacy for a variety of over-the-counter (OTC) service-delivery models, which have increasingly been identified as important options for managing mild-to-moderate age-related hearing loss.

Is the amplification intervention delivered using the OTC model an appropriate solution for age-related hearing loss? Although there is some evidence supporting the effectiveness of OTC HAs, all previous studies measured short-term outcomes (e.g., 6 weeks). It is unknown what the long-term outcomes of OTC HAs would look like. The purpose of this project is to examine the longitudinal changes in OTC HA outcomes over 3 months. Older adults with age-related hearing loss will be recruited. Pre-configured hearing aids (that simulate OTC hearing aids) will be provided to subjects.

Although hearing aids (HAs) are the primary intervention for the management of age-related hearing loss, only 15-30% of those who could benefit from HAs actually seek them out. HA adoption rates are even worse for people with lower income and for racial and ethnic minorities. One of the most commonly reported reasons for people not seeking HA intervention is the high cost of HAs and the associated audiological fitting services. Because HAs fitted using the audiologist-based service-delivery model are unaffordable, more and more Americans (1.5 million in 2010) purchase amplification devices via over-the-counter (OTC) service-delivery models to compensate for their impaired hearing.

Although OTC amplification devices are gaining popularity and are regarded as an important option for promoting accessible and affordable hearing healthcare, it is unclear if they are viable solutions for age-related hearing loss as OTC models exclude professional services. Further, although there is some evidence supporting the effectiveness of OTC HAs, all previous studies measured short-term outcomes (e.g., 6 weeks). It is unknown what the long-term outcomes of OTC HAs would look like. The outcomes could improve across time because users may eventually figure out how to use HAs. On the other hand, the outcomes of OTC HAs could become poorer across time because, unlike traditional HA fitting, users do not have professionals to support them.

COPD causes acute exacerbations where a patient has worsening symptoms (increased shortness of breath, cough, or sputum production). Managing COPD presents many challenges, as patients struggle to adhere to their prescribed treatment plans. Digital platforms are gradually becoming more available to enable providers to help patients manage their condition. These platforms create objective transparency, lessening the need for patients to consciously track their COPD exacerbation events, enabling providers to proactively manage their patients' condition, and creating actionable reports for providers to review with their patients. Ultimately, connected devices present a strong opportunity to provide patients with appropriate care earlier in the patient journey, while enabling pulmonologists to deliver more customized management based on close to real time objective data.

The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of the implementation of the ANNE ONE platform on patients with COPD's condition. This will be achieved by using the ANNE ONE platform to continuously track enrolled COPD patients' vital signs over the course of the study and digitally sharing that data with providers for clinical interpretation, potential intervention and treatment decision making.

Benign central airway obstruction (BCAO), as the name suggests, is narrowing the tracheal lumen from causes unrelated to underlying endoluminal or extrathoracic cancers. One common mechanism is mechanical stress on the tracheal walls with post-intubated tracheal stenosis (PITS), post-tracheostomy tracheal stenosis (PTTS), and stenosis related to airway stents. Inflammatory disorders such as sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), relapsing polychondritis (RPC), amyloidosis are frequently observed. Chronic atypical infections such as Tuberculosis have been implicated, especially in the developing world. Rarely an idiopathic form can develop in women's fifth decade of life, known as idiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis (ILTS).

First-line treatment for BCAO is dependent mainly on the complexity of stenosis. Tracheal sleeve resection with end-to-end anastomosis is recommended for patients with complex lesions and often is the only definitive treatment available for most patients. Bronchoscopic management has been recommended for simple lesions or patients that are not robust surgical candidates. However, the advances in both flexible and rigid bronchoscopic techniques have led to the treatment of more complex lesions. A multidisciplinary and multimodal approach is often necessary to achieve long-lasting airway lumen patency. Current bronchoscopic modalities include balloon dilation, argon plasma coagulation (APC), diode laser or monopolar cautery, stent placement, endoluminal steroids, antineoplastic agents, and Montgomery t-tube placement. Patients will likely need repeat procedures, which can be on the order of several weeks to years.

It is postulated that heat-based modalities may lead to thermal fixation of tissue with reparative healing and fibrotic scarring that may translate to the reoccurrence of fibrotic injury. In addition, using these modalities on patients with high intraoperative oxygen concentrations can lead to airway fires. Spray cryotherapy (SCT) utilizes liquid nitrogen in a metered fashion to flash freeze tissue with subsequent tissue necrosis that has many advantages that heat-based modalities can not offer. The truFreeze System (CSA Medical, Inc., Baltimore, MD, USA) utilizes liquid nitrogen through a 7-french catheter through the working channel of an endoscope. SCT works by rapidly releasing liquid state nitrogen stored at temperatures less than -196C in a circumferential dose area, leading to rapid hypothermic cell death on tissue. As a result, stenotic tissue undergoes intracellular ice crystal formation with eventual rupture and cell death. Unlike slow delivery of liquid nitrogen or contact probe freezing, this rapid expansion allows the extracellular matrix to be largely intact, thus facilitating wound healing without exuberant airway scar. Other potential benefits include using SCT with high oxygen concentrations, improved bleeding, use on materials that may be combustible such as airway stents, and studies showing improved balloon dilation with less chance of airway laceration.

The investigators hypothesize that the addition of SCT to standard endoscopic treatment modalities of BCAO will decrease stenosis recurrence at six months. The investigators plan to measure our primary outcome measure utilizing a novel noninvasive 3D volumetric tracheal reconstruction by CT scan. Secondary outcomes will include changes in symptoms based on a validated questionnaire, physiologic parameters of breathing, and changes in tracheal cell profile with SCT using single-cell RNA sequencing.

Randomization will occur in a 1:1 fashion, with the patients and outcome adjudicators blinded to the underlying intervention. Patients will have a thin cut CT scan within six weeks of the incident procedure, with pulmonary function testing and questionnaire administration within two weeks. The procedure will be done either with an interventional pulmonologist or otolaryngology, depending on the initial referral. General anesthesia is provided with either an endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask airway, rigid bronchoscope, or dedo laryngoscope, depending on the operator's preference and lesion location. The standard of care group will undergo radial cut incisions into the circumferential lesion followed by balloon dilation. The intervention group will undergo two cycles up to 10 second spray time of SCT, followed by radial cuts and balloon dilation. A final spray will be performed after with a standard freeze-thaw cycle. Five patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis will undergo cryobiopsy. These samples will be compared with controls for changes in cellular profile.

Patients will undergo a thin cut CT scan within 6 weeks after the procedure with repeat physiological parameters and a questionnaire. This CT will act as the personal best to compare to the final CT scan. Finally, at six months, the investigators will repeat these measures with a final CT scan. Throughout the follow-up period, patients will be given access to a mobile application program that will help patients self-monitor peak expiratory flows. If patients undergo a repeat procedure before the 6-month CT, they will be analyzed in an early reintervention subgroup.",Yes,No,Device	Device	Device,"Benign central airway stenosis (BCAS) is an important cause of both pulmonary morbidity and mortality. Notable causes include post-intubation stenosis, collagen vascular diseases, airway trauma, infectious and idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS). Surgery is the preferred definite option; however, the first therapeutic attempt is usually endoscopic to temporarily restore airway patency and symptomatic improvement.

Several endoscopic modalities exist for treatment. Most commonly, thermal or laser therapy to make radial incisions into the stenotic lesion, followed by balloon dilation to increase the area of patency. Clinicians may also inject steroids or antineoplastic agents such as mitomycin C. All of these methods have benefits and associated risks. Symptomatic stenosis frequently reoccurs with these methods. For example, the investigators have been doing 3-4 ballon dilations procedures a week at our institution.

Spray cryotherapy (SCT) is a novel FDA-cleared technique that allows for liquid nitrogen to be delivered through the working channel of a bronchoscope. Few retrospective studies exist without more robust clinical trial data to reduce the risk of bias and support its widespread use. The investigators postulate that SCT and standard of care techniques will improve airway patency volume at six months than the standard of care techniques alone.

PMNE affects 10-20% kids at 5 years old (1, 4, 5). It does resolve spontaneously so that 5% of 10 year olds and 1% of 15 year olds are still affected (2-4). Is more common in boys. While the disease its self is benign, and improves without intervention, it does pose a significant social and emotional burden on the child and their family. These include parental disapproval, sibling teasing, and inability to attend sleep overs with peers, all of which lead to families seeking treatment options (3, 4).

Current treatments start with conservative management. This includes appropriate fluid intake, scheduled toileting during the day, avoidance of bladder irritants and constipation (4, 5).

These individuals have persistent symptoms after completing conventional rehabilitation programs. Persistent post-concussion symptoms not only decrease quality of life (Ingebrigtsen et al, 1998), but also impair cognitive and motor performance and increase the likelihood of impaired driving performance (Preece, Horswill, & Geffen, 2010) and motor vehicle accidents (Bivona et al, 2012). While case reports indicate that biofeedback can reduce the number and severity of post-concussive symptoms (Lagos, Thompson, & Vaschillo, 2013; Thompson, Thompson, Reid-Chung, & Thompson, 2013), no studies have systematically evaluated these biofeedback treatment programs.

HRV biofeedback works by displaying beat-to-beat heart rate data to the participant, and through operant conditioning with breathing techniques, the participant learns to control their HRV (Lehrer & Gevirtz, 2014). This results in an increase in parasympathetic (PNS) activity and decrease in sympathetic (SNS) activity, which leads to reduced anxiety, and increased focus and concentration (Lagos, Bottiglieri, Vaschillo, & Vaschillo, 2012). Neurofeedback works in a similar fashion, except it monitors brain wave power, frequency, and connectivity using quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG). Brain functioning is displayed while playing an electronic game, and the participant learns through operant conditioning to increase the amplitude of desired EEG frequencies, such as low beta waves that are associated with active problem solving, usually while simultaneously decreasing the amplitudes of undesired EEG frequencies (Conder & Conder, 2014).

This will be an eight-week intervention where participants suffering from long-term post-concussion symptoms will be recruited using email from the cohort of individuals that have been discharged after completing a concussion rehabilitation protocol (BrainEx90) at Parkwood Institute in London, Ontario.

Nearly 40% of US children and adolescents have a body mass index that markedly increases their risk for serious metabolic and cardiopulmonary sequelae. Current childhood obesity rates, for the first time in US history, predict a decline in life US expectancy. Importantly, childhood obesity is a key driver of health disparities in the US, with obesity disproportionately affecting African-American, Hispanic-Latino, and Native American children. A key contributor to the sequelae of obesity is sedentariness. Thus, best practice in obesity management includes both reducing sedentariness and establishing durable increases in daily physical activity, however, attrition from planned exercise programs remains high. A key challenge to initiating and sustaining physical activity in children with obesity is the extreme dyspnea (breathlessness) they experience. This is due to the altered thoracic mechanics of obesity which lead to enhanced inspiratory muscle fatigue and dyspnea, with even modest physical activity. Our group has confirmed that among adolescents, higher body mass index (BMI) associates with lower inspiratory muscle endurance (r= -0.680, p=0.049, n=14), and that this lower endurance correlates with more frequent dyspnea (r= - 0.672, p=0.023, n=12).

Designing a computerized system that mimics the way insulin is produced naturally in a person who does not have type 1 diabetes holds many challenges; all of which cannot be addressed in just one study. The purpose of the Medtronic Overnight Closed Loop study is to assess the performance of a system designed to automatically infuse the correct insulin dose during the hours that the patient is sleeping.

The system consists of an insulin pump that provides insulin to the patient through an infusion set. A sensor inserted just under the patient's skin measures glucose levels and a transmitter sends this information to the pump. To enable the sensor to register the glucose information correctly, it must be set (calibrated) by a finger stick blood glucose 3-4 times a day. In the commercially released system, the physician would recommend the continuous background (basal) insulin rates and the patient would be required to make decisions regarding extra insulin (bolus) for meals or as a response to high glucose levels.

In the Closed Loop System, a mobile control system is added to these devices. This consists of an Android phone, a closed loop algorithm and a translator. This system is designed to translate the sensor information and direct the pump to provide the required dosage of insulin automatically without requiring input from the patient.

Reliable calibration has proved challenging, and so it is important that the system function safely, even when calibration is inaccurate. In this study, a calibration error will be introduced under very controlled circumstances.

Results from a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=72) demonstrated its efficacy in reducing externalizing behaviors and improving parent effectiveness. This project seeks to significantly expand iKinnect to prevent NSSI, suicidal behaviors (ideation, planning, attempts), and death by suicide in JJ-involved transition age (TA) youth while continuing to decrease externalizing behaviors and prevent recidivism. Usability and acceptability testing will be conducted to test new features with target end-users (youth and their parents/guardians) and key stakeholders (probation officers, parole/re-entry officers, administrators, people with lived experience). Once usability and acceptability is achieved, an eight-week pilot will be conducted to test study procedures followed by a 16-week randomized controlled trial comparing iKinnect2.0 to an active control mobile app. Investigators expect that iKinnect2.0 participants will report a significantly greater decrease in youths' suicidal, NSSI, and conduct-problem behaviors, and less recidivism.

Primary Objective: To determine the long-term efficacy of memory strategies in AD patients using experimental memory paradigms and standard neuropsychological tests. Over the course of 4 weeks, performance on novel memory tasks and standard neuropsychological tests will evaluate the efficacy of the strategies longitudinally.

Secondary Objectives:

To determine the neural mechanism of memory strategies in AD patients through portable electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) electrophysiology. Portable EEG will allow us to measure the electrophysiological changes associated with the use of memory strategies over time during daily life of patients with AD.
To determine how memory strategies, influence the daily life and functioning of the AD patients. Questionnaires on daily life activities will be administered at different timepoints to determine whether patients are able to generalize the strategies to tasks in their daily life.

This research study will investigate whether the use of combined memory strategies (conservative and deep/item-specific encoding) can help improve performance in memory tasks, can be maintained over time, and can be generalized to other tasks in daily life.

Generally, these individuals require a heart transplant or a mechanical circulatory support such as a left-ventricular assist device (LVAD). LVAD is implanted to liberate patients from crippling symptoms of heart failure, or in some cases avert imminent death. However, maintaining health and improving quality of life (QOL) depend on a ""trouble-free"" LVAD. Despite the refinement in circulatory support technology, many patients and their family caregivers still face challenges in managing the LVAD in home settings. The LVAD home-care regimen comprise of complex technical and non-technical tasks and procedures that must be implemented frequently and consistently. During the first 6 months following hospital discharge, patients/caregivers generally exhibit low levels of confidence (i.e., self-efficacy) in managing the tasks/procedures. This problem appears to contribute to low adherence to the regimen and poor outcomes. The current self-management processes include provision of instructional manuals and logs for vital signs, LVAD parameters, etc. To address this problem, the research team developed a mobile phone VAD Care App as a self-management tool. The app will aid and may ease patients/caregivers' problems in managing the complexity of the home-care regimen. The app offers patients/caregivers with (a) daily reminders about the tasks/procedures to be performed, (b) videoconferencing feature to communicate with healthcare providers about LVAD and health issues, and (c) on-line LVAD training/education. The prototype of the app was tested by 16 patients and caregivers. Results included ease of use and high acceptability and competency rates among users.The specific aim for the present study is to obtain preliminary efficacy data of the care app as self-management tool in patients with a long-term LVAD.

It mostly results from a difference in refraction between the eyes (anisometropia), a misalignment of the eye axes (strabismus), a combination of both, or visual deprivation (due to congenital cataract, e.g.). Besides a significant reduced visual acuity, the patients show binocular dysfunction leading to functional vision impairment like reduced reading speed, selective attention or motor control skills.

Whilst the disorder is commonly diagnosed around the age of 3-5 years, up to 50% of children will be left with residual amblyopia mainly due to a late diagnosis and start of treatment, poor compliance with treatment, not diagnosed or considered eccentric fixation. The gold standard treatment consists of the occlusion therapy, patching the dominant/healthy eye for 2-6 hours/day every day for several months up to years. However, an eye patch and the demand to use the weaker eye for visual tasks is challenging and so poorly complied with by pediatric patients. These problems in compliance lead to relapses (14-25%) or residual amblyopia (i.e., poor vision that persist into adulthood) creating multiple medical and social problems for the patients (including cognitive and emotional processing), their families and the society.

Serious videogames delivered on tablets have been developed with a more engaging strategy to effectively treat amblyopia. These games focus on binocular stimulation, which targets visual acuity of the amblyopic eye and three-dimensional vision (stereovision), through the presentation of dichoptic images. Such dichoptic image presentation consists of showing a different but complementary image in each eye so that the task can only be performed if information across eyes is combined. Binocular stimulation signifies that both eyes are challenged but the devices are programmed in a way so that the weaker eye is primarily performing a given visual task.

The objective of this project is to improve visual function of the amblyopic eye using image-fusion and stereopsis through playing videogames in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. Also, besides the improvements of visual acuity and potentially stereovision, such VR-based serious games interventions can positively impact other aspects like cognitive and motor functions. The visual deficits seen in amblyopia are thought to be related to problems in attending to visual task-relevant objects, suggesting that such deficits in selective-attentional skills can hamper vision recovery. Similarly, poor stereovision will be reflected in deficits in motor control skills as seen in individuals with amblyopia. Our VR-based serious games training will have similar ingredients to those that are supposed to improve attentional skills and may have a positive impact on motor control skills. The VR-based technology developed by Vivid Vision to be used in the present study is FDA approved and CE (Conformité Européene) certified. They are offering virtual reality videogames with headsets, which may increase the beneficial treatment effect by a reduction of the misperception of 3-dimensional movement.

The present project aims to test the described benefit in a home-based, child-friendly rehabilitation program involving serious video games in a virtual reality environment in children, adolescents, and young adults with residual amblyopia, compared to standard care (refractive correction) and to age-matched healthy individuals. The study has been designed as a blinded randomized cross-over trial to increase the available evidence allowing for a qualified evaluation of the benefit of binocular stimulation and for demonstrating a beneficial effect also in residual amblyopia in childhood and in older patients.",Yes,No,Device	Behavioral,"Amblyopia is the most common developmental vision disorder in children, caused by abnormal visual experience in early life, especially a difference in refraction between the eyes, a misalignment of the eye axes, a combination of both.

This is the multi-centre version of the recently completed single-site study (IRAS ID: 253844). This multi-centre version is required to confirm if the oesophageal cooling probe is definitively superior to standard care in protecting AF ablation patients and to clarify the extent of this protection.

At present, the method of protection is limited; an oesophageal temperature monitoring probe is inserted whilst the patient is under general anaesthesia and the temperature is measured during ablation, stopping if temperatures markedly increase, which may suggest significant oesophageal thermal injury. This method is unreliable as the temperature probe does not sit well in the oesophagus and is often too far away from the area requiring monitoring. The probe is difficult to place as it can coil.

The design of the project is in the form of a randomised controlled trial like the single-centre study, so participants will have a 50:50 chance of being allocated to the study group receiving the new oesophageal cooling probe or the standard care (or control) group, receiving the oesophageal temperature monitoring probe.

The patient is blinded to the result of the randomization, to avoid bias/placebo effect.

If enrolled to the study group, the oesophageal cooling probe will be used- called the ensoETM probe. This is a smooth medical-grade silicone multi-lumen oesophageal probe (the device has a CE mark and is designed for the purpose of oesophageal insertion and cooling) that allows water irrigation in a closed loop system, when connected to an external console. If the console cools the irrigated water (this is controlled by manual up/down buttons depending on what temperature is desired), the oesophageal probe is then cooled also, which allows local oesophageal wall temperature to be controlled. Oesophageal cooling via the ensoETM probe can then counteract any transmitted thermal energy from the ablation. This probe is already in clinical use in critical care patients where it can control body temperature, if the probe is left in situ for purposely extended hours or days. It is therefore already known to be safe; it also has a good safety profile in the context of AF ablations based on experience from the single-centre study (IRAS ID: 253844; in press- doi:10.1093/europace/euaa276). In the single-centre study, all participants had endoscopic examination after their ablation to review the oesophagus, and no device/probe related abrasive trauma was seen.

The procedure is normally done under general anaesthetic so the participant will not be aware of this and will not be subjected to any sensation of pain or discomfort. The probe is soft and much gentler than the camera probe that the team normally have to insert during the catheter ablation procedure (the camera probe or transoesophageal echocardiography, TOE- is part of standard care), so the study authors are of the opinion that this additional precautionary measure does not itself increase the patient's risk or exposure to harm.

After the procedure, all participants (study or control) will have an endoscopy camera between 12-72 hours after the catheter ablation procedure to review for degree of oesophageal thermal damage caused by ablation, if any. (Please note: A biopsy is NOT part of this research protocol; this is simply a diagnostic camera.) The endoscopist is also blinded to the result of the randomization to avoid bias during reporting of the endoscopy result. The short time window between ablation and endoscopy camera follow up means that it can be done at the same admission as the ablation procedure itself, this is advantageous for the patient as both the ablation treatment and the follow up camera can be completed in 1 hospital admission. The endoscopy camera result is explained to the patient on the day and if any further action required. The timing is also advantageous to minimise separate hospital attendances in the Covid-19 era.

After this, normal/standard care clinic follow up of the patient will be adhered to but as part of the trial, at the first clinic follow up, participants in both groups will be asked about any lingering gastro-oesophageal symptoms and a record is made of this, for the study. The patient is still blinded to the results of the randomization at the time of reporting their symptoms during recovery, if any. This is to avoid bias/placebo effect.

The research project does not create any areas of ethical concern as the soft oesophageal cooling device/probe is of gentle design, specifically made to sit in the oesophagus. Especially when compared to the TOE probe that is normally used as part of standard protocol for an AF ablation procedure. The patient will also not be aware of this step at all as the procedure is conducted under general anaesthesia. The device is appropriately CE marked and used for the indication of body cooling via the oesophagus and protection. Even in standard care, an oesophageal temperature monitoring probe is required, so effectively, this study simply randomizes the patient to either the new probe or the standard of care one, during their AF ablation.

There is one additional follow up the participant is required to have, as part of this trial: the endoscopy camera (regardless of if randomised to study or control group). The endoscopy camera will be completed by 12-72hrs post catheter ablation procedure. The purpose is to review any areas of inflammation or thermal injury in the oesophagus that may alter clinical management but this specific information will also be used during study analysis of the 2 randomized groups after the study has completed. An endoscopy camera is considered to be a low risk day case procedure that takes 20 minutes to complete. The risk of this camera test causing any damage itself is <0.5%. A TOE probe/any other oesophageal probe used during the ablation procedure is similar to the endoscopy probe so apart from the participant having to attend an additional appointment after their ablation, the overall risk to the patient is not significantly increased.

The follow up endoscopy camera may be slightly uncomfortable in the beginning but it is not painful, is straightforward and relatively quick- this will be explained in the beginning during the recruitment process so the potential participant has an accurate idea of what to expect from the endoscopy camera and if they are happy to be enrolled. There is added benefit to the patient from this follow up, as the endoscopy camera will confirm to the patient about any oesophageal injury from ablation and if any treatment is required. If no injury, this can help to reassure the patient before they go home. Lastly, the follow up clinics will be as normal for the participant, only that investigators will ask specifically for any ongoing gastrooesophageal symptoms as well. A record of this will be made.

The study authors reviewed the steps involved with this study design and conclude that no major ethical or legal issue has been identified. The summary of the steps involved here hopefully clarifies our viewpoint. From a management perspective, our centre is designed to conduct catheter ablation procedures for AF with general anaesthetic cover. The authors have experience and acquired the necessary equipment from the oesophageal cooling device company and have appropriate device management protocols and storage space in place. External funding for the project has been secured to cover for the additional cost of the oesophageal cooling devices. The endoscopy department at the centre is also equipped and supportive of this study and are able to conduct the additional follow up endoscopy tests post ablation. The team are already accustomed to endoscopy test requests from the department, due to strong clinical indication, post catheter ablation.

Lastly, the authors have conducted this proposed research trial at a single-site setting to great success and with excellent safety record with no probe-related trauma and the team did not encounter any new or unexpected issues or difficulties. The authors obtained good patient feedback from the single-centre study. This same trial will run at 5 sites across the UK with potential to further expand depending on statistical analysis.",Yes,No,Device	Device,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common debilitating heart rhythm condition that can cause heart failure and negatively impact a patient's outlook in terms of symptoms and disability. It is an irregular fast heart rhythm disorder coming from the top chamber of the heart (left atrium). Catheter ablation treatment has been shown to be effective in controlling or eliminating AF and its associated symptoms. This is now a common and effective treatment option for patients suffering with AF. During ablation, thermal energy is applied in the top chamber of the heart (the left atrium) to abolish abnormal electrical signals that cause AF. It is generally a safe procedure, but one potential risk associated with this procedure is damage to the oesophagus caused by thermal energy being transmitted to the oesophagus from the heart. The oesophagus sits just behind the heart chamber where ablation work is performed, about 5mm away, so it is vulnerable to damage. Although the risk of severe oesophageal damage is low, if it occurs it can be serious as the patient may become very ill as a result.

In a recent study, it was shown that a more advanced type of oesophageal probe that cools the oesophagus during ablation is better at protecting the oesophagus from ablation-related injury compared to the standard care probe currently used. As it was a single-centre study, more evidence is required before knowing if this type of probe is more effective in protecting the oesophagus.

The purpose is to run a multi-centre randomized study to compare the safety of AF ablation when there is protection by the oesophageal cooling probe versus the standard of care oesophageal temperature monitoring probe.

Twenty subjects with chronic cough and TBM diagnosed by bronchoscopy or computed tomography (CT) scan will be recruited to enroll 12 participants. Comorbid conditions that can cause chronic cough, such as asthma, COPD, and GERD, must be treated if present, for subjects to qualify. At the pre-baseline visit (V0), after obtaining verbal informed consent, each subject will complete validated cough questionnaires to quantify their cough severity and cough-related QOL at baseline. The baseline visit (V1) will occur in-person approximately two weeks later, after a run-in period to minimize observation bias related to the cough questionnaires. Written consent will be performed at this visit. At V1, the cough questionnaires will be repeated and subjects' airway resistance and reactance will be measured with impulse oscillometry (IOS). A study physician will perform a physical exam and determine eligibility. Eligible subjects will then be given the nPEP device by the study team and instructed on its use. Approximately four to six weeks after device delivery, at the follow-up visit (V3), cough questionnaires and IOS will be repeated and they will be asked for feedback regarding device design and user experience. Subjects may then be entered into a cohort for up to six additional months, during which there will be no study visits or procedures, but subjects may be contacted by investigators for additional narrative feedback on the device and its use.

Study subjects will be given an nPEP device to use for four to six weeks. During this time participants will be asked to remain on their current medical regimen and not to make any dose changes or add new drugs, unless indicated by their primary care provider. Impulse oscillometry will be measured at V1 and 4-6 weeks later at V3 to assess effect of the nPEP device on airway physiology. A lung CT scan will be performed at V2.

RETROSPECTIVE:

This device was tried on two individuals and it was initiative and was beneficial. Many patients are not candidates for tracheobronchoplasty itself due to medical comorbidities, prefer to avoid the associated risks, or are not candidates for the required tracheal stenting due to trachea size or anatomy. These patients are left without a viable therapeutic option for their severe cough.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices have been reported to stop or prevent cough in TBM, presumably through pneumatic stenting the large airways to maintain their patency during exhalation. CPAP devices, however, are not labeled for this indication and their functional utility is very limited given size of the device, need for a power source, and multiple steps to don the equipment that are not easily completed while actively and uncontrollably coughing.

The physicians aimed to provide positive airway pressure at a low cost and through readily accessible means, in order to abort coughing paroxysms in patients who were not candidates for tracheal stenting and did not have access to commercial CPAP devices. Patients at Duke University Hospital referred to the Interventional Pulmonary service for evaluation of severe, debilitating TBM-related cough and possible tracheal stenting, but who were not candidates for tracheal stenting given their airway anatomy, were given positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) masks assembled using existing hospital supplies. Specifically, a standard, adjustable (5-20 cm H2O) positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) valve manufactured for attachment to a manual resuscitation (commonly known as bag-valve-mask) device was attached directly to a flexible face mask, also from a manual resuscitation device. Patients were instructed by their physicians how to use the PEEP masks. The patients used the PEEP mask immediately during their clinical encounter and were given a mask to take home. (The device was created by fellow, Lindsay Boole.)

This was a limited intervention for a very small number of patients (two), specifically identified as being referred to Duke Interventional Pulmonary service with severe cough related to TBM, but with anatomy that ruled them out as candidates for tracheal stenting. There were no formal data collected and no separate follow-up for the purpose of this project (though patients had ongoing clinical follow-up per standard of care). The patients' subjective improvement with the masks was submitted as a case report abstract and poster at the American College of Chest Physician meeting in 2017.

Other physicians asked Dr. Boole about the mask and if it could be used for their patients. Therefore, the investigators would like to request a retrospective review of all patients that used the PEEP mask between January 1, 2009 and August 20, 2019 to be included in this pilot study.

Measuring the heart rate (HR) is important to estimate the suitable exercise training intensity and to determine the recommended exercise intensity (1). The 12-leads electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standers to measure heart rate, but it may be not suitable to be used outside the laboratory, therefore using the polar chest strap is the alternative to be used outside the lab and it has been tested against the 12-leads ECG during exercise and at rest in healthy subjects [2,3,4] and cardiac patients [5]. The HR following exercise is called heart rate recovery and it is important to predict mortality risk and cardiorespiratory fitness [6].

There is a liner relationship between the HR and oxygen consumption [7]. The Oxygen saturation (Spo2) is recommended to be monitored in patients with hypoxemia to extend their survival [8]. Some cardiac patients have hypoxemia particularly cardiac patients after cardiac arrest [9]. Pulse oximeter is a gold standard to measure the Spo2 [10].

The Apple Watch all versions can measure heart rate, but the latest versions-6 and 7 can measure blood Spo2. Photoplethysmography (PPT) is a non-invasive measurement procedure to evaluate the HR through wrist-worn devise by detecting each heartbeat changes in blood flow and changes colors in blood flow. The PPT has been used to measure Spo2, cardiac output, and blood pressure in many medical devices [11]. The PPT technology can help in early detection of some cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation [12].

A pilot study measured the HR agonist the telemetry in 50 cardiac patients (half of them with atrial fibrillation (AF) and other half with normal HR rhythm) during rest, through assessments of the HR 3-times/ day for two days. They found that the HR accuracy in patients with AF (r=86) was more than the cardiac patients who have normal rhythm (r= 0.64) and the overall accuracy was (r=070) but this still pilot study and more studies with large sample size are needed to confirm this findings in addition to presence of some limitations in this pilot study, as including of 3 black participants that could affect the accuracy of the results, presence of other interfering devices near the Apple Watches devices during evaluations in the cardiac wards and the fluid and edema after operation[13]. Moreover, the accuracy of the Apple Watch in measuring the HR during exercise is still unknown with cardiac patients and cardiac patients with AF.

Another study measured the HR from the Apple Watch against the 12-lead ECG during the cycle ergometer test for 30 seconds at three times (at rest (ICC=0.72), moderate exercise intensity (ICC=0.82), high exercise intensity (ICC=0.95)). The results revealed that the accuracy of Apple Watch has been increased with increasing exercise intensity in 40-patients with cardiovascular diseases, with good correlation at all three times [14].

A recent study measured the HR in 80 cardiac patients including some AF in phase-II or III in cardiac rehabilitation (exercises including steady cycle and treadmill). The study measured the HR from the limbs leads of ECG against the Polar HR, Apple Watch, Fitbit Blaze, Garmine Forerunner 235, and TomTom Spark Cardio (one instrument on each wrist), which means only 40-patients tested with the Apple Watch. They recorded the HR at rest and at 3, 5 and 7 minutes of cycle and Treadmill training. They found that the polar chest strap (r=0.99) was the most accurate during all exercises to the ECG followed by the Apple Watch (r=.80) and the Apple Watch accuracy during cycle increased to (r=0.89)[5]. However, the proportion of the AF in 80-patients was low (12 AF) and they were mix with the normal HR, so it could not know if the AF affect the accuracy of the Apple Watch or not and the 8-time points measured in this study was good, but if the study measured the heart rate every 15 or 10-seconds the results could be more meaningful. This study suggested that validation of the Apple Watch with AF should be investigated.

The new feature of measuring the blood Spo2 established in the Apple Watch is includes only on series 6 and 7. There is only one study examined the validity of the Apple Watch against two pulse oximeters to measure the Spo2 in 100-participants including 16-healthy subjects and 84-patients with medically controlled pulmonary diseases (including 23 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 61-patients with interstitial lung diseases. They found that the Apple Watch has strong positive correlations with the pulse oximeter (r=0.81, P<0.0001) [15]. Moreover, the study suggested to test the validity of the Apple Watch for measuring the blood Spo2 in other groups of patients.

The Apple Watch is a smart watch measuring the HR and the Spo2 but its validity in cardiac patients including patients with abnormal HR patterns is still unknown. Therefore, this will be the first study to evaluate the Apple Watch accuracy and validity for measuring the HR at rest, during and after exercises and to measure the Spo2 at rest and after exercises in patients with cardiac diseases including cardiac patients with normal HR and cardiac patients with abnormal HR patterns.

Method:

A cross sectional study will be invited one-hundred cardiac patients to participate in this study. The first group will be around 50 cardiac patients with sinus heart rhythm and the second group will be around 50 cardiac patients those with irregular heart rate. The distribution of patients into two groups will be based on the availability of the cardiac patients at Umm Al-Qura University Medical Center. Each participant will wear the Polar chest strap HR and the Apple Watch at rest, during exercises for 15 minutes and after exercises. The pulse oximeter will be used at rest and after exercises. The exercise session will be about 15-minutes duration at mild to moderate intensity according to the heart rate reserve (HRR) using the treadmill and the cycle ergometer, preceded by a 3-minutes warm-up, and followed by 3-minutes cool-down. The HR will be recorded every 30 seconds during whole period and the oxygen saturation will be recorded five times at rest and after exercises.

This study will follow the Declaration of Helsinki 1975 principles, revised in 2000 and will be conducted at the Umm Al-Qura University Medical Center, and will be in line with the Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al-Qura University ethical guidelines. Each participant will sign a written consent approving the volunteer participation in this study and agreeing for publication of its results. Suitable sample size was computed using the online G-power tool (https://download.cnet.com/G-Power/3000-2054_4-10647044.html), considering the effect size = 0.4, giving a sample size of 54 participants to provide reliable results. Extra-number will be included to substitute any participant's withdrawal or discontinuation.

Inclusion criteria: eligible participants will be cardiac patients as those with myocardial infarction (6-weeks post-insult), coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG), cardiac patients with valve diseases, stable atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF)-I,II and III, with and resting ejection fraction (EF) greater than 50%.

Exclusion criteria: Cardiac patients with unstable angina, uncontrolled high blood pressure, unstable arrhythmia, presence of complex ventricular arrhythmias, ST-segment depression ≥2mm from baseline during exercise testing or recovery, pacemaker patients will be all excluded from the study.

Risk management:

All measurements in this study will be done as the normal measurements for each cardiac patients who visited the Umm Al-Qura University Medical Center, so there is no risk for the patients to take part in this study. Moreover, the exercise intensity will determine for each patient, so each patient will do the exercise intensity that suitable for them. In case any terribly ill happen because of the study procedure, the cardiologist (Dr.Mahmoud) will be supervised each patients in this study.

Note: This study will not use any questionnaire to collect the data.

Data analysis:

All data will enter into the SPSS program for analyses. The results of this study may will analyze using the Pearson correlation test to test the difference between the Apple Watch and Polar heart rate for measuring heart rate and between the Apple Watch and Pulse oximeter for measuring SpO2 to test the validity. The P value will be set at 0.05 for significant results.",Yes,No,Device,"Background: Apple Watch validity to measure the heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (Spo2) in healthy subjects has been investigated, but its accuracy and validity for patients with cardiac diseases is still unclear. The HR is an important measure to determine the recommended exercise training intensity and to monitor the training intensity in patients with cardiac diseases. The target exercise training intensity during cardiac rehabilitation is between 40% to 70% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Also, cardiac patients who have hypoxemia are advised to continuously monitor their Spo2. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the accuracy of the Apple Watch in measuring the HR and Spo2 in Saudi patients with cardiac diseases.

Method: A cross sectional study will be invited one-hundred cardiac patients will be invited and recruited to participate in this study and the eligible participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. The first group (Group-A) will include the cardiac patients with regular HR and the second group (Group-B) will include the cardiac patients with irregular HR.

The HR and the Spo2 monitoring, and recording will run on a 30 second schedule at rest (pre-session; for 3-minutes), during the 15-minutes session and over 5-minutes after the session). The main outcomes will be the HR and the Spo2 and will be evaluated before, during and after the exercise session using the Apple watch and the Polar HR monitor.

PD prevalence rate in the United States is estimated to be approximately 0.3% and is ranked the fourteenth leading cause of death (CDC, 2013). Depending on the methodology, the national prevalence data on PD is varied and insufficient. PD is projected to increase by 4% to 5% in age 65 and over 85 years respectively and is associated with a high economic burden exceeding $14.4 billion per year.

Admission to the hospital is identified as a major risk factor due to imprecise timing of medication administration, disruption of sleep pattern, dietary changes, and unfamiliarity of the hospital environment which all contribute to the exacerbation of PD symptoms. Parkinson's disease Foundation, 2015). Hospital length of stay for patients with PD is 1.45 times higher in comparison to non- PD patients.

A study by Chou et al., (2011) involving 51 worldwide National Parkinson Foundation Centers found 94% of centers were not confident in the care and knowledge hospital professionals provided specific to: PD medications, complex drug interactions, contraindications and precise timing of medication administration. Hospital co-morbidities could be improved or prevented by adjustment of PD medication and medication adherence, critical in decreasing hospital length of stay.

The retrospective phase will be a data collection of adult patients admitted with a primary and secondary diagnosis of Parkinson's disease during January - June 2015 (6 month period). There will be 150 patients selected by the principal investigator(s) from chart review. In addition, the clinicians chosen for the study will complete a Parkinson's Disease Knowledge Assessment Survey.

The prospective phase will begin after completion of the Parkinson's Disease Inpatient Clinical Knowledge and Management Program for staff nurses, advanced practice nurses (APN), nursing assistants, patient care technicians, case managers, adult inpatient physician assistants, pharmacists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurse educators, and dietitians. There will be 150 patients selected from the adult inpatient units by the principal investigator(s) that meet the inclusion criteria and confirm through an informed consent that they will participate in the study.

The selected patients will be registered in a WatchRx interface via website URL by the Principal Investigator(s) and the Transition of Care(TC) Pharmacist and required to wear a Watch Rx smartwatch for the duration of their hospitalization. The Watch Rx Interface will store all medical information, necessary treatments, and daily clinical care for the patient which is synchronized to the smartwatch on the patient's wrist. The smartwatch will send alerts to the patient's assigned nurse's iPad through a Watch Rx app for medication administration, missed PD medications, battery conditions, and enables messaging between the primary nurse and the patient.

The WatchRx smartwatch will remind when it is time to take the medication. If the Parkinson's Disease medication is not administered, it sends missed medication reminder alerts to the nurse. For fixed time medication, the reminder is every 3 minutes up to 10 minutes.

During the prospective phase, the research team will collect data from multiple sources such as the Watch Rx system, EPIC Hyperspace, and Case Report forms over a 6 month study period. The data will be calculated by using statistical analysis for the continuous variables and categorical variables identified from the collection of data. All study data will be imported into SAS software where data programming will be utilized to flag and generate queries on out-of-range data issues until they are resolved. All analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.

Abnormalities within the brain-gut axis, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system are important components contributing to the pathophysiology of IBS. Despite recent advances in medical therapies for IBS, a significant subgroup of patients fails to experience satisfactory relief of abdominal pain. Given evidence of anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive components of vagal nerve pathways, peripheral field stimulation of the vagus nerve may help reduce abdominal pain in patients with IBS.

Percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation (PENFS) administered via the IB-Stim device (Innovative Health Solutions, Versailles, IN, USA) has been shown to be efficacious in adolescent patients with abdominal-pain-related functional GI disorders, including IBS. This device uses discontinuous frequencies of stimulation to target central pain pathways through branches of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X that innervate the external ear and project to certain brainstem nuclei, including the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). The NTS then acts as a relay station to other brain areas involved in pain modulation and autonomic control, including the rostral ventral medulla, locus coeruleus, hypothalamus, and amygdala. In adolescent studies, PENFS was associated with a greater reduction in worst abdominal pain and composite abdominal pain scores from baseline as well as compared with a sham device after three weeks of treatment. These effects were sustained over an extended follow-up period with minimal to no side effects. In addition, a greater proportion of adolescents in the PENFS arm achieved at least a 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain scores from baseline after 3 weeks of treatment.

The IB-Stim is the first device to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of functional abdominal pain in adolescents aged 11-18 with IBS. However, the efficacy of PENFS in adults with IBS is not currently known.

It is well documented that, alongside a high comorbidity with chronic pain, chronic insomnia also has high comorbidity with, and is a risk factor for, developing an anxiety disorders. Research has shown that Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) are efficacious in treating patient with comorbid insomnia and chronic pain (e.g., improvements in sleep parameters, normal sleep efficiency, reductions in pain severity. CBT addresses a number of factors involved in the maintenance of patient sleep and health issues, and a key piece of CBT for insomnia and pain is the reduction of worrisome thoughts, or anxiety related to sleep and pain issues. A common evidence-based strategy used for reducing anxiety and worry is the practice of relaxation. The aim of this study is to investigate the benefits of replacing treatment as usual (TAU) relaxation practices, with Virtual Reality (VR) mediation environments within CBT treatment.

Virtual Reality Meditation for Anxiety

There are few studies in the literature demonstrating a relationship between Virtual Reality (VR) - a computer generated environment that presents the user with a realistic three-dimensional space - and reductions in anxious symptomology. However, the results of those studies are very encouraging. In a case study, Tarrant and Cope treated 4 firefighters who had anxiety and anxiety-based disorders with a Positivity VR Experience. 3 of 4 treated patients exhibited increased left gamma symmetry, associated with approach behavior and increased mood, and 3 of 4 patients showed increases in State-Cheerfulness and Positive Affect. Tarrant and colleagues also conducted a pilot study, where they treated 14 patients who had moderate or higher levels of generalized anxiety with a 5-minute Mindfulness in Nature experience. Patients in the VR meditation group showed both global and regional decreases in Beta activity (i.e., decrease in frequencies associated with qualitatively anxious states and decreased self-reported State Anxiety. Overall, these results seem promising, as they provide preliminary evidence supporting that VR interventions may be a useful and effective tool for the treatment of elevated anxiety symptoms.

In summary, this clinical trial will examine the effects of VR meditation environments on patients with pain- and insomnia-related anxiety. The proposed study design will yield important information about the efficacy of VR meditation practices. The purpose of this study is to examine the benefits of using VR meditation with patients with chronic pain and chronic sleep disturbance so that clinicians can more effectively treat core causes to symptoms and reduce counterproductive therapies.

Ultimately, this research targets two important public health concerns, namely insomnia and chronic pain. Insomnia in the context of chronic pain has been relatively understudied. Thus, the results of the present study will provide unique insights into sleep and chronic pain and will advance knowledge in the fields of both sleep and pain. Although the results of this study will be specific to chronic pain patients, they will have broader implications for other medical populations likely to suffer from chronic pain and insomnia (i.e., cancer patients, older adults). The information gained has the potential to make a significant contribution to behavioral healthcare practices for a wide variety of disorders, not just insomnia and pain. Thus, this research has implications not only for future sleep and pain research but also for other types of treatment-related research.

Despite a range of biological and environmental risk factors for DBD, social-cognitive impairments are a common link, and improving these deficits should be beneficial for all patients with DBD.

Children and adolescents with DBD have deficits in social perspective taking that contribute significantly to these behavior problems. Perspective taking is the ability to perceive the world from another person's point of view, including making inferences about the capabilities, feelings, and expectations of others. Perspective taking requires substantial motivation and cognitive resources and can be difficult to achieve, particularly for children. A failure to understand or value another person's perspective inhibits helping behavior without clear direct benefits. Perspective taking skills are related to empathic concern, which encompasses feelings of sympathy and concern for unfortunate others, and theory of mind, the ability to accurately infer others' mental states, such as intentions. Negative attribution biases are more likely in individuals with poor theory of mind. Thus, improving children's perspective-taking skills should allow them to better understand a counterpart's thinking and intentions, increasing empathic concern, and reducing hostile attribution biases-and therefore improving the likelihood that prosocial behavior occurs.

In the brain, perspective taking engages circuitry underlying empathic concern and theory of mind. In fMRI studies, imagining pain to the self or other, often in conjunction with images depicting painful scenarios, engages the brain's salience network. Dorsal ACC and bilateral anterior insula, the regions most commonly activated in response to other's pain, also show strong responses to self-perspective pain. However, in youth with DBD, there is a decreased response to other-perspective pain in dACC and anterior insula, despite no change or a heightened response to self-perspective pain.

Software interventions have shown some promise to improve perspective taking. In particular, VR has exciting therapeutic potential to address perspective-taking deficits because it provides naturalistic yet controlled environments in which users can experience interactions from multiple viewpoints. VR interventions typically provide better generalization to real-world behavioral changes compared to traditional methods. VR has an advantage over traditional interventions because it provides an embodied experience that is a middle ground between therapy room settings and the real world (e.g., school, home) where problematic behaviors occur.

In this investigation, the investigators will build upon a current VR design using an Oculus Quest virtual reality headset. After experiencing virtual interpersonal conflicts in a school cafeteria setting, participants will re-experience scenarios in one of two manners: an enriched perspective from the virtual counterpart's point-of-view, with internal dialogue and background information; or a control perspective, which replays the original point-of-view. During this proof-of-concept phase, the primary target is social perspective taking.

Dr. Edward's is an expert in testing central sensitization using quantitative sensory testing (QST).12 QST involves cutaneous (skin) psychophysical (semi-subjective) testing to assess sensory and pain perception pathways.13 QST identifies the intensity of stimuli (touch) is needed to feel something (threshold of detection) and how perception of stimuli changes if it is repeated many times (temporal summation).14 In people with central sensitization, even light intensity of stimulation is perceived as pain and similar intensity stimuli becomes more painful with multiple applications. We hypothesize that people with chronic pain will demonstrate clinically important reductions in the threshold of detection and temporal summation after IVR, which will demonstrate that IVR can affect central sensitization.

Prescription opioid related overdose deaths accounted for 40% of all opioid deaths in the US in 2016. In surgery, opioids are an effective tool in reducing pain in the postoperative state. However, this may lead to dependence if pain control is poorly managed. A study examining analgesic use after low risk surgery found that patients requiring a second prescription for opioids within 7 days of their surgery were 44% more likely to become long-term opioid users one year after their surgery.

n order to combat this issue, the concept of multi-modal analgesia has been promoted to reduce the use of opioids for postoperative pain. This modality includes medications (e.g. NSAIDS), regional anesthesia, and adjunct therapies such as meditation and acupuncture.

Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology in which a person is immersed in an environment through visual and audio cues that effect the senses. These effects can lead to all types of reactions based on the content and as such, virtual reality is used as a platform for, amongst other things, entertainment, education and patient care.

In health care, virtual reality has been used to desensitize patients with various phobias, provide surgical training and as an effective tool for pain control. At this time, there are no studies demonstrating the use of virtual reality for pain control after gynecologic surgery.

This is a feasibility study to asses if VR can be used for postoperative pain control and whether a VR relaxation program used in the immediate post operative period after laparoscopic hysterectomy will decrease pain scores and reduce both oral and intravenous opioid consumption. If this study is feasible the investigators would then be able to perform a larger study, which could show if VR does or does not reduce postoperative pain. Possible benefits from this study include improved pain control requiring less narcotic medications during the time spent in the PACU after laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indication. It could also provide improvement of anxiety associated with the postoperative period. This intervention could be a benefit for all women who desire to use non-pharmacologic measures for pain control during the immediate postoperative period. Alternatively, the patient can proceed without the intervention if desired. There are many other pain control methods that the patient can still use during the study. Nothing will be withheld from the patient due to the study.

Recruitment will take place in the outpatient clinic and the preoperative area of the Main Operating Room or Same Day Surgery Once a potential study patient has been identified, a written informed consent form will be provided by a member of the research team to the patient. The member of the team will review the consent form with the patient and she will have the opportunity then to chose to voluntarily participate or decline with the understanding, should she decline, this will in no way affect her care. After all her questions have been answered and she elects to participate in the study, she will sign the consent and a signed copy of the consent will be provided to her for her records. This will be at not cost to the subjects.

Risks include exacerbation of claustrophobia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting due to how the VR works. There are very few risks associated with the intervention. There is a 0.025% risk of seizures, particularly in patients with a known seizure disorder. Theoretically patients with claustrophobia could have exacerbated symptoms, however, these symptoms have not been seen and recorded. Patients with these risk factors will be excluded from the study. There is another theoretical risk of increased nausea, although this has not been shown to occur in previous studies site them.

Our exclusion criteria helps to reduce the possibility of adverse effects from experiencing VR. Once consent forms are signed, they will be kept in a locked drawer of the fellow involved. All data will be collected via RED cap, which is a secure website. When the patient is randomized, they will be given a subject number. This will be used to de-identify the patient.

Adverse events/reactions will be reported to the UA IRB. In the case of injury or illness resulting from this study, emergency medical treatment is available from Banner University Medical Center Phoenix but will be provided at the usual charge. No funds have been set aside to compensate the participant in the event of injury. Their insurance company will be charged for continuing medical care and/or hospitalization.

To assure their study-related costs are paid for, all study-related procedures/tests must be conducted at a Banner Health facility.

he data collection sheets will be stored in the fellows office (Room 3113, 1441 N 12th St. Phoenix, AZ 85006). Information from these forms, and demographic data collected from the patient's chart will be stored in REDcap and only be accessible by members of the study.

Subjects can decide to be removed from the study at any time from when they first consent to the study to when they fill out the survey at the two week postoperative visit. Their withdrawal will be noted in RED cap. The paper forms used to collect data will be destroyed and their virtual data collection sheets will be deleted from REDCap.

All consents will be done in either private exam rooms within the Women's Institute clinic in the 1441 Building of Banner University Medical Center or the private preoperative bay on the day of surgery. Only those involved in consenting and data collection will be allowed to access the consent forms and place data in REDCap.

The patient would be committed to the study during the postoperative recovery period in the PACU, which is approximately 4 hours. They will also be asked to complete a brief survey at the time of their 2 week postoperative visit. If not, they will be mailed the survey to complete and return.

The control group will have no changes to routine PACU protocol. They will be asked to rate their pain at defined intervals that can later be compared to the pain scores of the intervention group. Morphine equivalents during PACU stay will be calculated for the control group. The intervention group will also be offered the routine PACU protocol. The only change being the addition of offering the VR intervention which includes the Samsung VR Innovator edition goggle set, fitted with Samsung Galaxy Note 4 mobile phone. The module options are provided from Applied VR and include Guided relaxation (30 minutes), a tour of Iceland (3 minutes), Dream Beach (30 minutes), Dolphin Swim (15 minutes), Farm Sanctuary (5 minutes), Seal Hospital (10 minutes), and Wild West (5 minutes).

Prior to each new subject use, fabric surfaces of the Samsung Gear set will be cleaned with VIrex, Sani-Wipes will be used to clean the plastic housing, and the glass lenses will be cleaned with an alcohol-based lens cleaner. Each headset will be fitted with a sanitary disposable fabric cover on the VR goggles for new users. Each subject will also wear fitted head caps that minimize direct contact with the devices. At time of recruitment, patients will be given the opportunity to try on the VR goggles and watch the four chosen VR modules that will be offered during their PACU recovery period. At that time, subjects will be instructed on how to apply the head gear. Subjects will apply and remove the headgear themselves, while their trained PACU nurses will be able to assist them in adjusting head straps once the VR goggles have been placed. Subjects will be able to discontinue use of the VR goggles at any time they wish, including before the conclusion of their chosen VR module. There is no minimum or maximum amount of time patients will be allotted to participate in VR modules during their PACU stay. The total amount of time using the VR system and number of separate uses will be recorded. After each patient completes the study, the disposable head cap, fabric covers and foam backing from the devices will be discarded.

It is routine for patients to follow up two weeks after their surgery for a postoperative visit. At that time, they will be asked to complete a survey addressing their satisfaction with the postoperative recovery process in the PACU. If they are not seen in 2 weeks, the survey will be mailed, or the subjects will be contacted via phone to complete the survey.

Up to 30 patients will be recruited for this pilot study. A Master Log will be created that includes patient ID number, patient name, MRN, and date of surgery. The data collection form will be created that includes patient ID number, age, height, weight, BMI, VR Y/N, preoperative diagnosis, past medical history, ASA classification, initial pain score, final pain score, total morphine equivalents used during post-anesthesia recovery unit (PACU) stay, length of time from admission to discharge from PACU, number of uses of VR, total VR use time, and other medications given also include if/when local analgesic was used, what type and where. RedCap is an online data tool that will be used as to collect and store data. At the end of the study, the Master Log, which will be the only document containing patient identifiers will be destroyed.

A review of the study will be performed half way through the process (when 15 subjects have participated) to assess the safety of the study. The investigators will assess how many, if any, of the participants in the study had adverse effects to the protocol.

Opioids, the most frequently prescribed class of drugs to control pain, lack evidence supporting their long-term efficacy and carry a 15-26% risk of misuse and abuse among pain patients, highlighting a critical need to develop effective non-pharmacological interventions for pain. Guided imagery (GI), a cognitive-behavioral technique for guiding patients to create multisensory, imagined scenes to increase well-being, is an effective non-pharmacological intervention for reducing pain. However, its effectiveness is limited by patients' imaging abilities. The long-term objective of this project is to reduce chronic pain and opioid use by developing an at-home virtual reality (VR)-GI intervention to improve chronic pain management using the Limbix VR Kit. Given the enhanced immersiveness and interactivity of VR, VR-GI is expected to reduce pain and reliance on opioids, as well as improve functional outcomes and mood, compared to traditional audio-only GI and usual care. The specific aims are to evaluate feasibility and usability of an at-home VRGI intervention in a 2-week clinical trial. Two 15-min VR-GI experiences that guide patients through psychoeducation, relaxation exercises, and interactive virtual worlds that allow them to control their experience of pain will be evaluated. To assess feasibility of an at-home VR-GI intervention, 36 patients with chronic pain (18 with chronic back pain, CBP, and 18 with complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS) will complete a 2-week intervention with at-home daily practice of VR-GI (n = 24) or audio-only GI (n = 12).

Despite its prevalence and impact, the success of currently available treatments is mixed, highlighting the need for novel approaches that aim to reduce symptoms and improve outcomes. Prior research has demonstrated that reduced activity in a part of the brain, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), is associated with an inability to regulate fear responses, preventing the generation of safety memories and allowing PTSD symptoms to persist. Targeting the VMPFC with non-invasive electrical brain stimulation may therefore alleviate these symptoms.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation that may enhance the likelihood of neuronal activity in the VMPFC. In doing so, tDCS prepares the brain to respond to external stimuli and to facilitate learning and memory. Because therapeutic success from exposure to trauma-related content - as used in exposure-based therapy for PTSD - is thought to be based on an adaptive learning process, applying tDCS in combination with exposure to trauma cues may effectively boost exposure-based learning. To do this, investigators at the Providence VA Medical Center will use a standardized virtual reality (VR) setting to deliver trauma-related content. The virtual reality setting involves three, 8-minute driving scenarios, which consist of VR stimuli (sights, sounds, smells, etc.) often encountered in combat training and in theater.

The study will be performed on volunteers who are reporting to the phlebotomy lab to have venipuncture for blood draws that were previously ordered by their health care providers. Participants who were not already scheduled to undergo routine venipuncture will not be included.

When approaching the ticket stand to draw a waiting number for the lab, prospective participants will be asked by an assistant investigator located near the kiosk if they are interested in participating in the study. If the participants express interest, they will be directed to the screening station. The screening station will be set up in a private room near the lab waiting area, and participants will be screened for eligibility and educated on the benefits and risks of the study. They will also provide informed consent if they decide to participate.

All participants will be asked to fill out a self-reported data questionnaire in addition to the informed consent document to assess for inclusion and exclusion criteria discussed later in this protocol. This questionnaire will assess the participant's expected level of anxiety prior to the procedure and expected level of pain associated with the procedure by utilizing a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS will be on a 100 millimeter line.

Once approved for participation in the study all participants will undergo a brief instructional class on how to operate the HMD and will be allowed sufficient time to become comfortable with its use. The investigators expect approximately 5-10 minutes to be required for this portion of the study. Once familiar with the use of the virtual reality headset, participants will be asked to randomly draw an envelope from a container. This envelope will contain a block and sequence number. The block and sequence number will be the subject identification and will correspond to a predetermined number set on a separate document that will determine if the participant will use the HMD during venipuncture or not. The screener will not have immediate access to the list showing which group the participant will be assigned to. One member of the study team will be present in the lab room to ensure the participant uses the virtual reality headset (or not) according to what is randomly drawn. This member of the research team will have the list showing whether or not the participant is assigned to the control arm or the experimental arm. The participants will then proceed to the specimen room to undergo venipuncture.

Venipuncture for both groups will be occur in the non-dominant arm. The reasoning for this is that the Oculus Go requires one free hand to use a controller. This will ensure that the individuals participating are able to effectively use the device. Those unable to undergo venipuncture in the nondominant arm will undergo venipuncture in the dominant arm instead and will use the Oculus Go dominant arm will undergo venipuncture in the dominant arm instead and will use the Oculus Go controller with their non-dominant hand.

Those utilizing the Oculus Go HMD will be interacting with the virtual reality game Ocean Rift. They will utilize a single controller to explore an underwater safari park. Ocean Rift has multiple environments to choose from, including coral reefs, ship wrecks, lagoons, the arctic, and prehistoric seas. Participants may interact with and and learn about different creatures to include dolphins, turtles, orcas, ray, whales, sea lions, manatees, and dinosaurs. During the game users may travel where they please and interact with what they choose. The virtual reality device is equipped with head-tracking software that allows the user to choose direction by looking around. The entire interior and exterior of the headset will be cleaned with alcohol-based wipes after each use. Alcohol will be used since it is generally well-tolerated on human skin, and since it evaporates quickly. The headset will be dried in the open air for a minimum of two minutes between each subject's use.

Those not using the virtual reality will still wear a headset that will simply be turned off. This is to ensure that any significant change noted with the virtual reality is due to the use of virtual reality itself, and not simply due to ""blindfolding"" the patient during the procedure.

As some patients experiencing anxiety may be tempted to move during the procedure, lab personnel will instruct participants to remain still during venipuncture. Participants will be advised that they may take breaks as needed if anxiety becomes overwhelming.

After undergoing the procedure, each participant will be asked to fill out the postprocedure questionnaire and return it to the study team member present in the lab room, who will clean the headset as the participant completes the questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses the patient's pain intensity and level of anxiety with the VAS similar to the VAS assessing pain, as well as the patient's satisfaction with the visit which will be measured utilizing a Likert scale for individual questions.",Yes,No,Device,Adult patients aged 18-50 undergoing blood draw for routine lab evaluation will be randomized to a control group or experimental group to assess if the use of virtual reality reduces procedural pain (primary outcome) and procedural anxiety (secondary outcome) during venipuncture.,"Can Virtual Reality Reduce Patient's Pain, Improve Patient's Experience, and Reduce Procedure Related Anxiety With Venipuncture?

Biofeedback, which involves the provision of real-time information about physiology, is a well-studied approach to enhancing self-regulatory ability, with potential promise for alleviating mental health problems. In children (as well as adults), biofeedback may be ideally facilitated through video game environments, which offer engaging, immersive, yet dynamic environments that can be changed in real-time. Video games are enormously popular with youth, and may represent an important avenue for treatment in adolescent populations. The current proposal aims to evaluate a novel virtual-reality-based video game treatment for emotional dysregulation for youth currently under the supervision of the juvenile justice system. Exposure to risk factors known to promote impaired self-regulation, such as child mal-treatment, is nearly endemic in this population. Indeed, 'delinquent' youth (i.e., youth in contact with the justice system) are considerably more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for a range of disorders centrally involving dysregulation of affect or arousal, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, and many others.

The deleterious effects of the opioid epidemic have been well studied at both the individual and population level.2 3 Orthopaedic trauma patients in particular have high rates of psychological stress and disability related to protracted narcotic usage 5. However, opioid medications may not need to be the mainstay of pharmacologic pain management for patients with orthopaedic injuries. For example, one recent study from the Netherlands showed that 82% of patients with ankle fractures treated in the United States were prescribed opioids at discharge, whereas only 6% of Dutch patients were given narcotics. 6

Non-pharmacologic interventions for pain management in the acute orthopaedic injury setting deserve full investigation. Virtual reality for pain management has been used in burn patients, pediatric patients, for procedures under local anesthesia and in the chronic pain setting.

We are hoping to discover that the device is easily adopted by patients and increases the dose of rehabilitation, as well as potentially leads to motor recovery.

With the increasing affordability and accessibility of virtual reality (VR) systems, VR has emerged as a new platform for stroke rehabilitation. VR therapy involves using computer-based programs to simulate daily tasks and events. VR has shown promise in both allowing patients to practice activities that directly translate to their ADLs, as well as motivating them by providing a novel and interesting virtual environment.

Relevance Regaining upper extremity function is very important for stroke survivors to increase their independence and ability to perform ADLs.

A common treatment for symptoms related to disorders of vestibular function is vestibular rehabilitation, a sub-specialty of physical therapy. These exercises are performed daily by Subjects at home and consist of visually fixating on a target while moving the head and/or the object on which the subject is fixating. To alter exercise difficulty, exercise parameters are altered including: visual background complexity (plain and dark, busy but stationary, moving objects, rapidly moving objects), postural positioning (seated, standing with a wide base of support, standing with a narrow base of support, standing on one leg), and duration of exercise (from 5 seconds to approximately 2 minutes). Early evidence shows that vestibular rehabilitation exercises provided by a physical therapist is an effective method of ameliorating vestibular hypofunction. Further, effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation does not decline with increasing age of the patient,8 indicating benefit for all ages that are affected. Unfortunately, many factors limit the ability to determine efficiency and efficacy of treatment and have been highlighted in a recent clinical practice guideline9 and systematic review5,10. Limitations include: poor measurement of prescribed exercise compliance by depending on subjective report, inability to control for environmental factors during home program execution, and the influence of noxious vestibular input associated with traveling to attend scheduled physical therapy visits. These factors hinder performing high quality efficacy studies, resulting in exercise prescription being largely based on expert opinion, the lowest level on the hierarchy of evidence-based practice.11 In fact, current opinion indicates that exercises should be performed 3 times a day for a total of 12 minutes with each bout lasting approximately 2 minutes, all with no clear indication of speed and amplitude of performance. In this study, the investigators aim to use a commercially available virtual reality device to deliver usual vestibular rehabilitation exercises, while using the device's inbuilt sensors to accurately measure head movement, speed and duration. Using this device, the investigators will assess compliance and dose of exercises required to reduce symptoms of dizziness and imbalance and to determine if performing such exercises in a virtual reality environment will provide similar results to that usual rehabilitation techniques.

When a potential subject is identified, the subject will be screened for appropriateness of inclusion for this study. After informed consent has been obtained from a recruited subject, those with Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction (UVH) will be asked to perform a 4-week intervention, while those with Bilateral Vestibular Hypofunction (BVH) or those post-concussion will each be asked to perform a 12-week intervention. Those with UVH will undergo a shorter intervention due to strong evidence that neural adaptation occurs much more quickly (usually 4 weeks) than those with BVH and history of concussion.9,10,17-19 The intervention will consist of physical therapy visits combined with a home program of specific vestibular exercises. Each subject will be asked to attend physical therapy visits at least one time per week throughout the 4- or 12-week period.

Assessments will be performed on all groups and consist of a combination of vestibulo-ocular assessment, balance and clinical functional outcome measures, and surveys of subject satisfaction. Subjects are randomly assigned to the usual rehabilitation or intervention group based on each of the following diagnostic categories.

The compliance to exercises will be obtained from a log in the virtual reality device for the VR group, and will be paper based for the usual physical therapy group. Subjects in the three intervention groups will be asked to perform the same type of exercises as the usual rehabilitation group, but using a virtual reality device that will be issued to the patient for home use. Subjects will use a custom designed program to perform the exercises using a commercially available virtual reality device (no specialized hardware or additions to the commercially available device will be performed). Subjects will be instructed on the first day in how to operate the Virtual Reality Vestibular Rehabilitation (VRVR) program and how to properly perform the exercises. The VRVR device and software will simulate a virtual reality 'room' with an 'X' fixed in front of a wall. There are six different background complexities. Exercise sessions will start seated upright in a chair and will progress to standing per the home exercise protocol. The system will prompt the patient to begin the exercise and will automatically log the frequency and duration of exercise performed. The system will ask the patient to rate the severity of their symptoms on a 0-10 scale before and after each bout of exercise. Subjects' instruction regarding initial dose and progression will be identical to those given in the usual rehabilitation group. Subjects will be asked to bring their device with them to their 4 week, 8 week, and 12 weeks appointment to transfer their de-identified data and to insure integrity of the data and device. Subjects will be asked to return the device at the end of the intervention period.

Per patient and therapist discretion, additional physical therapy visits may be scheduled to aid in patient understanding of exercise progression protocol, assess correct performance of exercise (with or without virtual reality device). Non-study related physical therapy visits may be scheduled between sessions in order to address impairments unrelated to vestibulo-ocular deficits. These may include interventions to address musculoskeletal deficits or other balance related impairments. Any additional sessions of physical therapy will be reported in order to determine possible confounding information.

There will be an additional group of healthy control subjects that will be tested for only one day. Healthy subjects will be recruited through flyers, approved email lists, and word of mouth in the general public. This healthy control group will perform the same tests as the other groups perform on Day 1.

Even though more than 35% of those over 40, and ~50% of those who have had concussion have such symptoms, the dose of specific exercises targeted to improve symptoms is not well defined. In this study, the investigators will use a wireless VR device to measure key parameters and response to exercise. Another advantage of the VR device is the ability to control what the individual can see while performing the exercise. In normal daily life, moving objects and distracting backgrounds can make vestibular exercise too uncomfortable to perform. Using these methods, the investigators aim to determine the appropriate type and amount of exercise required for symptom improvement.

Although virtual reality (VR) was originally recognized for its entertainment value, it has recently been used as an innovative tool in clinical settings to reduce pain and anxiety, while improving patient satisfaction. VR is a computer generated simulation of a life-like experience that usually serves people for entertainment and social interactive purposes in a simulated three-dimensional environment. Virtual reality therapy (VRT) offers patients an opportunity to ""get away"" from noxious stimuli as they draw their attention towards another virtual world (Alem).

Virtual reality provides a cognitive distraction through creating a ""real world illusion."" VR may deter an individual's attention from pain as it offers a multimodal sensory distractor. This positive experience may result in reduction of pain score by decreasing the time patients think about their pain during a procedure.

Genicular nerve radiofrequency ablation (GNRFA) is an option to treat knee pain without surgery. The genicular nerves are the nerves that feed into the knee. Radiofrequency ablation is a process by applying radiofrequency waves to the nerves that are carrying the painful impulses from the knee joint. GNRFA uses fluoroscopy guidance to introduce 3 needles at each of the three genicular nerves which transmit sensation from the knee joint. This is followed by testing for sensory response, followed by administration of local anesthetic (2% lidocaine) per standard-of-care, and then radiofrequency ablation. This method of treatment is known to be very safe, convenient and reliable because fluoroscopy guidance provides high accuracy of localization at the procedure targets outside of the knee joint.

The physical rehabilitation process requires commitment by the participant to achieve meaningful gains in function. Rehabilitation approaches that are cognitively engaging can facilitate greater commitment to practice and improved movement learning.

The investigators propose to develop innovative platforms that utilize virtual reality (VR) and instrumented wearables that enhance cognitive factors during motor learning of hand grasp and reach after SCI. These factors include greater sense of agency, or perception of control, and multi-sensory feedback. Sense of agency is implicated with greater movement control, and various sensory feedback modalities (visual, audio, and haptic) are proven effective in movement training. However, these factors are not well considered in traditional physical therapy approaches.

The investigators have developed two novel cognitive-based platforms for rehabilitating grasp and reach function and propose to test each platform in Veterans with chronic SCI at the cervical level.

Aim 1 will investigate how the ""cognition"" glove may improve functional grasp. This glove includes force and flex sensors that provide inputs to a machine learning algorithm trained to predict when secure grasp is achieved. The glove alerts the user of secure grasp through onboard sensory modules providing visual (LED), audio (beeper), and tactile (vibrator) feedback. During training, feedback is provided at gradually shorter time-intervals to progressively induce agency based on the neuroscience principle of 'intentional binding'. This principle suggests that with greater agency, one perceives their action (i.e., secure grasp) is more coupled in time to a sensory consequence (i.e., glove feedback). The glove is user-ready, and now has compatibility with customized VR applications to provide enhanced sensory feedback through engaging and customized visual and sound alerts. The investigators hypothesize that enhanced feedback in VR will produce even greater improvements in grasp performance than onboard feedback alone.

Aim 2 will investigate how Veterans with SCI may learn greater arm muscle control during virtual reaching while using a ""sensory"" brace that provides isometric resistance to one arm to elicit electromyography (EMG) patterns that can drive a virtual arm. The person receives visual feedback from VR and muscle tendon haptic feedback from the brace during training. Tendon stimulation can elicit movement sensations that modulate muscle activation patterns. The VR feedback will provide conscious movement training cues while vibration feedback will subconsciously elicit more distinct EMG patterns based on cluster analysis. The investigators hypothesize that the promotion of distinct EMG patterns, achieved by maximizing inter-cluster distances, will improve performance of a reach-to-touch task.

Primary:

To determine whether advanced VR- and AR-based therapy, improves functional status and reduces self- reported symptoms in SMs with vestibular dysfunction and a history of mTBI.

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that after completion of vestibular physical therapy, participants in the CAREN and AR groups will have better outcomes than those in the CPT group. In the CAREN and AR groups, the investigators anticipate greater improvements in static and dynamic balance, as measured by the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB&M), and Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), as well as decreased vestibular symptoms, as measured by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC).

Secondary:

To determine whether participants in the advanced technology groups demonstrate similar clinical improvements following treatment.

Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that after completion of vestibular physical therapy, participants in the CAREN and AR groups will show similar improvements in static and dynamic balance as well as vestibular symptoms; essentially, the investigators believe the VR- and AR-based therapies will be comparable.

Of the ~795,000 new strokes occurring annually, approximately 2/3rds of survivors will have some degree of long term disability. The prevalence of post-stroke disability coupled with the fact that more people are surviving stroke reflects an increasing need to develop effective rehabilitation strategies aimed at reducing disability and improving quality of life for the millions of stroke survivors, their families and caregivers.

The overwhelming majority of stroke survivors, >75%, exhibit upper extremity (UE) hemiparesis, and only 15% will recover fully. Furthermore, residual UE impairment is closely linked to long-term disability and reduced quality of life. Current meta-analytic evidence supports virtual reality stroke rehabilitation interventions for improving UE function suggesting that this is a promising area for further therapeutic development.

Duck Duck Punch (DDP) is an interactive computer game deliberately designed to enhance UE movement quality via individualized progressive movement practice along with an array of performance metrics allowing for within-session feedback on movement performance. Although response to UE virtual reality rehabilitation interventions, such as DDP, involves a multitude of factors, neuroplastic changes are a primary mechanism underlying functional recovery. Thus, pairing DDP with a priming intervention to facilitate a 'neuroplastic-friendly' environment may make the CNS more amenable, and enhance response to DDP rehabilitation and ultimately improve outcomes.

Aerobic exercise (AEx) training has positive benefits on overall brain function including enhanced global cognition, executive function, and processing speed and attention in healthy, older adults. Additionally, a single session of AEx acutely improves motor memory and learning in younger, healthy adults. Although AEx has been used to improve cardiovascular function following stroke, its neurofacilitatory effects in stroke have yet to be tested empirically. Candidate mechanisms through which AEx enhances brain function and motor learning include changes in circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and corticomotor excitability. BDNF is believed to play an integral role in several neuroplastic processes and promotes the strengthening of synaptic connections, i.e. long-term potentiation (LTP) and current research indicates that AEx can acutely and chronically increase circulating BDNF. Corticomotor excitability (CME) is often used as an indicator of LTP-like neuroplasticity and may underlie improvements in motor memory and learning. Similarly to BDNF, AEx can acutely enhance corticomotor excitability in control and chronic stroke subjects. Facilitating central nervous system function provides rationale to determine the role of AEx in 'prime' the brain for a subsequent intervention to maximize neuroplastic potential.

Movement-based priming for neurorehabilitation involves performing movement or exercise before, or concurrent to, a therapeutic intervention with the goal of improving the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention. Emerging evidence supports AEx as a potential priming tool for UE stroke rehabilitation. AEx combined with UE task training can improve UE function and self-reported health status in chronic stroke survivors. Despite the promising results, there are gaps in the literature involving: 1) the clinical applicability of an AEx priming session; and 2) mechanisms contributing to changes in UE functions in response to AEx-primed UE rehabilitation. Addressing these gaps will be necessary to develop an AEx primer that is potent and time efficient, with respect to current clinical models. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot proposal will be to establish initial feasibility and tolerability benchmarks via the following aims:

Demonstrate the feasibility of pairing AEx + DDP in stroke survivors with UE hemiparesis
Quantify the magnitude of the effect of the AEx + DDP intervention on UE impairment and function
Examine the relationship of biomarkers of neuroplasticity (BDNF and corticomotor excitability) and response to AEx + DDP

To accomplish these aims, chronic stroke survivors with moderate UE hemiparesis will undergo 18 sessions of AEx + DDP training. Each week, for six weeks, subjects will undergo three sessions of AEx + DDP. During each session subjects will complete 15 minutes of aerobic exercise followed by 200 repetitions of DDP.

AEx has been shown to improve overall brain function and promote a healthy brain environment; thus it may serve as an effective 'primer' and enhance the effects of DDP. Movement-based priming for rehabilitation involves performing movement or exercise before, or simultaneous to, an intervention with the goal of improving the effectiveness of the intervention. AEx combined with UE rehabilitation can improve UE function and self-reported health status in chronic stroke survivors. However, gaps remain regarding the clinical applicability of an AEx priming session and the mechanisms contributing to changes in UE functions in response to AEx-primed UE rehabilitation. Therefore, the aim of this project is to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of pairing AEx + DDP in stroke survivors; 2) quantify the magnitude of the effect of the AEx + DDP intervention on UE function; 3) examine relationship of biomarkers of the nervous system and response to AEx + DDP.",Priming Upper Extremity Motor Practice With Aerobic Exercise: A Feasibility and Pilot Study,Rehabilitation	Upper Extremity	Aerobic Exercise	Motor Function,"Subjects will perform 15 minutes of aerobic exercise on a recumbent stationary cycle.

A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is human's ability to respond correctly to novel contextual situations on the first attempt, without prior rehearsal. The investigators refer to this ability as 'ad hoc self-programming': 'ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; 'self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. The overall goal of our research effort is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior. The previous U01 project (NS 108923) focused on how these programs of action are initially created. The results thus far have revealed tantalizing notions of how the brain represents these programs and navigates through the programs. In this proposal, therefore, the investigators focus on the question of how these mental programs are executed. Based on the preliminary findings and critical conceptual work, the investigators propose that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) creates representations of the critical elements of these mental programs, including concepts such as 'rules' and 'locations', to allow for effective navigation through the algorithm. These data suggest the existence of an 'algorithmic state space' represented in medial temporal and prefrontal regions. This proposal aims to understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of this algorithmic state space in humans. By studying humans, the investigators will profit from our species' powerful capacity for generalization to understand how such state spaces are constructed. The investigators therefore leverage the unique opportunities available in human neuroscience research to record from single cells and population-level signals, as well as to use intracranial stimulation for causal testing, to address this challenging problem. In Aim 1 the investigators study the basic representations of algorithmic state space using a novel behavioral task that requires the immediate formation of unique plans of action. Aim 2 directly compares representations of algorithmic state space to that of physical space by juxtaposing balanced versions of spatial and algorithmic tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment.

The simulations are in a multi-media format and include graphic representations, voice and text. In the assessment component each of the six task domains includes subtasks that graduate in difficulty (e.g., check savings account balance, transfer money between accounts). The training component is designed to: 1) be consistent with adaptive training models of learning (tailored to the individual's skills); 2) adhere to current training guidelines for older adults, 3) identify the current levels of an individual's ability on the task with Item response theory strategies; 4) use dynamic-titration feedback from immediate task performance to adjust task difficulty to optimize training potential; and 5) provide immediate feedback and graduated instruction following errors, followed by repetition of the previously failed item. Performance metrics are captured in real time and include measures of accuracy and efficiency.

This is a blinded study in which every participant will be evaluated, and each participant may select the stimulation that best suits him or her on both of the study devices.

Each participant will select his/her preferred stimulation level by pressing the power level button on the study device; however, they will be blinded to which device they are using. Study participants will be asked to use the devices whenever they are having a symptom of vertigo. Each participant will be asked to record his/her level of vertigo in the online Study Diary: before putting on the device, after wearing the device for 5 minutes, after removing the device.

The study devices will record the following information regarding usage: Date and time when the device is turned on/off and the power level, Date and time when the power level is changed and the new power level.

Participants will be allowed to use the device as long as they are getting benefit from the device at any power setting that they select. Participants will be asked to complete an entry in the Study Diary even on days on which they do not experience a vertigo episode.

Because of the tremendous deleterious mental health and socioeconomic impact of PTSD, research to understand and treat all aspects of PTSD is vitally important. One less recognized but highly significant consequence of PTSD is an increased risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CV) disease, and its risk factors. Despite the epidemiologic data demonstrating increased CV risk in PTSD, very little is known about underlying mechanisms. This project will help fill this gap by examining the mechanistic role of sympathetic overactivation in PTSD. Sympathetic hyperactivity has a major role in causing and sustaining hypertension, and contributes to the development of heart failure, arrhythmias, and atherogenesis. Moreover, exaggerated SNS responses during mental stress are associated with an increased risk of hypertension and CV disease.

Slow breathing is an integral part of many ancient meditative practices that are purported to have beneficial physiologic and psychological effects. Clinical applicability of slow breathing requires a method for delivering slow breathing exercises to outpatients on a consistent basis. This can be achieved through device-guided slow breathing (DGB) in which breathing rate is slowed to < 10 breaths/min via an interactive biofeedback device. The RESPeRATE (Intercure, Inc.) device is currently FDA approved for adjunctive treatment of high blood pressure and reduction of stress. This device includes a belt-type respiratory sensor, earbuds to provide audio feedback, and microprocessor that measures adherence and success at achieving slow breathing rates.

Vagal nerve stimulation has been shown in both animal and human studies to safely and effectively reduce sympathetic activity and inflammation. tVNS is a noninvasive method that involves placing a device over the skin overlying the vagus nerve on the neck. The device delivers mild electrical stimulation, using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit. Prior studies have shown that transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation safely and effectively reduced muscle sympathetic nerve activity in healthy humans and improved heart rate variability, indicating a decrease in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, and a shift in cardiac autonomic function toward parasympathetic (PNS) predominance.

The purpose of this study is to determine if device-guided slow breathing or tVNS improves sympathetic activity and vascular function in persons with PTSD. Participants will be randomized to 15 minutes daily of DGB vs sham-DGB, or tVNS vs. sham-tVNS for 8 weeks.",Yes,No,Device	Device	Device	Device,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent anxiety disorder that is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and hypertension.

The participant places the elastic belt with a respiration sensor around the upper abdomen, and wears earbuds for audio feedback. The device monitors the breathing rate, calculates inspiration and expiration times, and generates a personalized melody of two distinct ascending and descending tones for inhalation versus exhalation. Users effortlessly entrain their breathing pattern with the tones, and the device gradually guides the user to a prolonged expiration time and slower respiratory rate (to < 10 breaths/minute). The device automatically stores usage data, allowing for quantification of adherence and performance.	The sham device is identical to the DGB device, except it does not guide respiratory rates to slow down and instead maintains a rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The recommendations to wear compression gear in athletes is based on improvement in venous blood flow which improves exchange of fresh blood and blood waste. The findings of research on its use to improve running performance has been mixed. Anecdotally, in 2001 Allen Iverson of the National Basketball Association (NBA) wore a compression arm sleeve to prevent swelling and provide relief of bursitis in his elbow. Lebron James of the NBA and London marathon runner Paul Radcliffe both swear by compression gear. In the 2016 Olympics, it was estimated that 90% of athletes used some form of compression performance gear. (1) The compression wear sports industry market is a billion-dollar industry projected to be worth 3.96 billion dollars by 2022.(1) Clinicians traditionally prescribe compression gear to reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms in a vein. Usually this clot forms in the leg or pelvic veins. Symptoms of DVT's can vary from swelling in a particular region, sensitivity, and on some occasions, there may not be any clinical signs. in hospital patients who are immobile or undergo surgery and that are at increased risk for DVT's. Compression gear also reduces the risk of DVT's in a variety of other health and environmental conditions which include, but not limited to, long periods of being immobile, older age, illness and prolonged sitting.(2) These clots can become life threatening as they can travel to the lungs, potentially leading to a pulmonary embolism (PE) and death. (2,3) Dr. Beasley coined the term ""e-thrombosis"" hypothesizing that the increase in computer use for work and decreased physical activity would lead to an increase in DVT's and PE's brought on by immobility and prolonged sit time.(4) Fast forward to the present where esports and video game use has exploded at an astronomical rate, and Dr. Beasley's theory would be fortified by many case studies and clinical studies documenting computer use is a major contributor to DVT. There have been over 22 documented cases of DVT's brought on by excessive gaming in the past few years. (5) Although DVT's are not the norm, gamers have nearly double the risk of developing a thrombolytic event as compared to non-gamers.(6) A triad of physiological changes has been proposed that increase the risk of DVT. The first one is changes in blood flow, the second is changes in the blood itself, and lastly is the integrity of the endothelial lining of the blood vessels. Typically, when we are moving, skeletal muscle goes through contraction and relaxation to help pump blood throughout the body and against gravity. When in a sitting position the velocity of blood flow in the upwards direction (against gravity) is reduced. After 3 hours of uninterrupted prolonged sitting, femoral artery blood flow can decline up to 50%. (7,8) Even in children 7-10 years of age, femoral artery blood flow decreased by 33%.(9) This decreased blood flow disturbs homeostasis, can result in blood pooling in the lower extremities, creates procoagulant changes in the blood, endothelial activation and is the primary cause of DVT. Several studies have demonstrated that a 3 minute light walking break at 30 minutes can increase popliteal blood flow by up to 30% and improve cerebral blood flow.(10-12) In a recent study by the current author (DiFrancisco-Donoghue et al.), it was reported that the average collegiate gamer sits 4-8 hours daily while practicing their craft.(13) These extended hours of sitting and play time can vary extensively among recreational gamers as reported in table 1 by Lippi et al.(5) Based on these findings, the authors' current study observed a 6 minute walking break compared to a 6-minute resting break in prolonged gamers on cognitive function. This study was conducted virtually during the pandemic and currently under review. The 6-minute break was based on findings by Chrismas et al. who found a 3-minute walking break at 30 minutes improved attention and executive function.(12) Breaking up an esport game every 30 minutes is not reasonable, therefore we chose to break at 60 minutes of play using the cumulative time of 6 minutes. This study demonstrated an improvement in executive function in the 6-minute walking break compared to the resting break following prolonged game play. Due to the pandemic, since the investigators were unable to collect physiological data on participants, we are adapting the same protocol without testing executive function, but rather observing the physiological changes that occur from a walking break and from using compression wear.

Athletes in various sports wear compression garments with the assumption that it will improve performance and facilitate muscle recovery. Most modern compression gear is marketed toward athletes use 'graduated compression'. This means that the highest amount of pressure is on the most distal parts of your body (e.g ankles if you are using lower body compression) and the pressure gradually reduces as it moves up toward your body. Compression wear varies in pressure range. The measurement is measured in mmHg and light compression can range from 18-21 mmHg, moderate 23-32 mmHg, strong 34-46 mmHg and > 49 mmHg very strong. (14) Most over the counter athletic compression garments range from 18-21 mmHg.

Twelve healthy collegiate esport players will be recruited for this pilot study. This study will be a randomized cross-over design trial which will require subjects to come to the NYIT esport gaming lab at least one hour post prandial for 3 testing days lasting 2.5 hours. The room will be kept temperature controlled for each subject and kept within 2-3 degrees Celsius each testing day. Subjects will sign a written consent and then rest quietly sitting in the gaming chair for 10 minutes. After the rest period, popliteal artery blood flow velocity, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and shear rate will be assessed at rest using a doppler ultrasound bilaterally. Carotid artery blood flow will also be measured. Blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed.

Testing day 1: Following the 10 minute rest/measurement phase, all subjects will play continuous for 2 hours on day one with no break. During the seated period measurements will be taken bilaterally at 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours on the legs and the carotid artery. The popliteal artery is located behind the knee. The subjects will extend the leg slightly to allow the technician to take the measurements while remaining seated. The carotid artery is located laterally on the neck region. In the current study, the measurements will be conducted while seated by the radiology technician.

Testing day 2: This study will use lower leg graduated compression garments with a compression between 20-30 mmHg. Each leg will be fitted according to manufacturer instructions. Following the resting measurements, subjects will be instructed to wear the garments and moved to the seated gaming position for 2 hours. During the seated period blood flow velocity, FMD and shear rate will be taken within the first 10 minutes upon sitting as well as 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours on both compression legs and the carotid artery.

Testing day 3: The 6-minute walk will be conducted indoors next to the esport lab in the Wisser library at NYIT, Old Westbury. Participants will be asked to walk for 6 minutes on a flat surface back and forth following one hour of game play. All blood flow measures will be taken prior to the subject standing and conducting the walk. An investigator will be timing them. Prior to the walk the participants will be shown the 6-20 BORG Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE) that will be held up by the investigators. This RPE is a validated scale to measure how hard a person feels they are working during physical activity and has been validated to correlate heart rate and perceived effort during active videogame play.(15) The subjects' heart rate will also be taken by brachial pulse prior to walking and following the 6-minute walk. Upon return to the gaming lab, all blood flow measurements will be repeated. The subjects will then play for another hour where all measurements will be repeated following the gaming session.

A routine training day for a competitive esport player can range from 5- 10 hours of play with no break. In comparison, office workers perform an average of 130-180 keyboard and mouse inputs over the course of an 8 hour work day. These APM's require sustained wrist extension in conjunction with repetitive forearm muscle contractions in multiple planes, as well as shoulder stability and postural stability.

Maneuvering a mouse and keyboard requires repeated contractions of the extensor carpi ulnaris and extensor digitorum. With these fine motor demands, it is common for players to suffer from acute and chronic overuse wrist and arm injuries.

Muscle tissue oxygenation (Sm02) saturation is important to all athletic populations including endurance athletes and power athletes. It's a marker of how efficient that muscle is performing. A decrease in Sm02 indicates less ATP to that muscle and fatigue. Muscle deoxygenation and reoxygenation has been studied in multiple athletic populations. In competitive rock climbers, a lesser rate of deoxygenation of the finger and wrist extensor muscles was related to a higher level of climbing ability.

The vast majority, >75%, of stroke survivors experience paresis of one arm/hand that does not resolve acutely. Long-term arm movement impairment restricts independence with self-care and vocational activities, increases caregiver burden and reduces quality of life. Although rehabilitation improves outcomes, systematic financial pressures increasingly limit its duration. Unfortunately, this is happening at a time when strong evidence is emerging that traditional therapy programs do not provide adequate amounts of movement practice needed for motor recovery. Thus, there is a need for innovative technology to augment traditional stroke rehabilitation programs in a way that can provide the necessary movement practice within the constraints of current rehabilitation practice.

To meet this need, the Principal Investigators developed a prototype Kinect-based post-stroke rehabilitation game called Duck Duck Punch (DDP). While maintaining the appeal of a game, DDP has a therapeutic focus because its unique design elicits an arm motor recovery process consistent with evidence-based stroke rehabilitation principles. The player moves his/her physical arm to control an avatar arm to reach and ""punch"" virtual ducks. Custom features allow tailoring of game difficulty to match a player's impairment level so that the player seeks to accomplish optimally challenging movement goals. By design, the avatar does not respond to atypical arm motions, which encourages the player to trial and error a variety of motions until implicitly learning the more normal strategy. Thus, unlike most commercially available ""off the shelf"" games, success requires ""therapist approved"" healthy arm motions. Success motivates continued game play for extended practice of healthy motions. Therapists can integrate DDP into in-clinic or in-home therapies for additional quasi-supervised movement practice and receive a performance report that quantifies and monitors progress toward recovery goals. Further development of this report will enable its integration into a billable rehabilitation program.

The Investigators licensed DDP and formed a company, Recovr, which has received investment funding for initial start-up and market research. Of note, DDP has also received FDA 510(k) Clearance to ""support physical rehabilitation of adults in the clinic and at home via performance of therapist-assigned reach exercises for the upper extremities."" In a funded NIH/NIGMS pilot project, the investigators established the technical merit and feasibility of DDP as a tool to augment inpatient, outpatient and home-based stroke rehabilitation by increasing therapist- and patient-directed movement practice opportunities. Very promising results motivated the current project that seeks to test the functional viability of DDP and determine its commercial potential.",Yes,No,Device	Behavioral,"This study has 2 parts: In one part of this study, people with stroke will either play a custom designed computer game for stroke rehabilitation called Duck Duck Punch or an off the shelf computer game with their weaker arm 3 times per week for 6 weeks.

Conventional physical and occupational therapy help improve motor recovery in ABI but nearly 50% of the patients still suffer from a significant level of upper limb motor impairment following rehabilitation, undermining the need for novel therapeutic approaches to improve recovery. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) have shown great promises as adjuvant means to improve the efficacy of neurorehabilitation in Stroke. However, the benefit of combining NIBS with regular motor training has not been extensively studied in the TBI population.

One of the inherent challenges with the approach in dealing with the heterogeneity of the TBI population in terms of the type of injury and the location of the affected cortical region which warrants personalized intervention than a one-size-fits-all approach. Therefore, we propose to develop an individually targeted high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) protocol to optimize its effect and achieve maximal upper limb motor recovery in each patient by stimulating the hand knob region which is close to precentral gyrus. HD-tDCS will be combined with MusicGlove exercises (music-assisted repetitive finger movements) to improve the neuroplasticity (adaptation and reorganization to compensate for the initial insult and to attempt to restore function) and fine motor learning while keeping patients engaged. Using a double-blind design, 24 individuals with an acquired brain injury will be randomized to either receive real or sham HD-tDCS during MusicGlove therapy to assess the added benefit of HD-tDCS. In addition, we aim to investigate the underlying neural mechanism of HD-tDCS on motor recovery by studying change in EEG based brain connectivity because of the intervention.

The short-term significance of this project will be to validate the effectiveness of HD-tDCS in ABI neurorehabilitation and help better understand the underlying cortical mechanism of the improvement. In the long-term, the findings of this pilot study will contribute toward the development of an optimal patient-specific rehabilitation therapy to maximize motor recovery in individuals with neuromuscular disorders.",Yes,No,Device	Device,"Acquired Brain Injury (TBI) is a serious medical and health problem in the US. Individuals with an acquired brain injury due to stroke and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) commonly suffer from upper extremity physical impairments that persist even after years of injury; these deficits are attributed to the damage to brain structure and changes in structural and functional connectivity. Although the conventional rehabilitation approaches are helpful in assisting motor recovery often there is a complaint of fatigue due to the repetitive tasks and also, nearly half of the ABI survivors do not regain their ability to use their arms for daily activities.

To address this issue, Dr. Shenoy's proposed study will investigate the combined use of individually targeted non-invasive brain stimulation and music-assisted video game-based hand exercises to achieve functional recovery. Further, the project will also investigate how the intervention modulates brain activity (recorded using EEG) in terms of brain connectivity before- and after the -intervention. In the end, this study will allow us to understand the cortical dynamics of ABI rehabilitation upon brain stimulation.

Robotic Assist Rehabilitation Made Easy. https://medical.barrett.com/). Activities are directed by therapists and encourage patient involvement through video game activities providing active proprioceptive, vibrational, visual and auditory feedback. Engaging and colorful games are beneficial in holding patients' interest, and gravity assistance may also allow for increased repetition in the face of patient fatigue.

In this prospective study, the investigators will determine if a standardized BURT Upper Extremity (UE) program can be consistently implemented within an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). In addition, the investigators will see if patients who receive BURT have improved UE mobility and function as a result. The investigators will also study the perceived enjoyment and value of the intervention by patients, and perceived value by therapists.

Because BURT therapy is able to provide more repetitions of upper extremity movement in a shorter length of time than conventional therapy, the investigators hypothesize that patients who participate in neuro re-education activities using BURT will achieve greater improvements in strength, upper extremity function, fine motor coordination, activities of daily living and mobility during their time in an IRF than patients receiving conventional therapy.

Adequate hand function is critical to a functional upper limb, and is often resistant to conventional therapeutic interventions. Many stroke survivors have residual ability to flex the fingers, but extension is often limited and impeded by increased passive stiffness in flexors, involuntary activation of flexors and inability to activate extensors. The rationale for this approach stems from the growing evidence that neuro-rehabilitation after stroke may be enhanced via the application of motor learning strategies within the context of repetitive movement practice. The key therapeutic aspects of these strategies are high repetition, volitional effort, and successful completion of tasks to prevent frustration. While these represent promising therapeutic strategies, they are limited to mildly impaired subjects who already have enough control of finger extension to tolerate high repetitions of grasp/release tasks without succumbing to fatigue and/or frustration. There is a very large population of stroke patients who don't fall into this category and often must rely on compensatory strategies.

However, patient etiology and prognosis varies considerably, and guidance about how to best treat patients has relied on large clinical trials that only include snapshots of the syndrome (at the time the patient interaction with the healthcare system). It remains to be seen whether behavioral interventions can improve patient engagement, increase self-management of the conditions, and thus improve overall clinical outcomes.

Digital health technologies have a great potential to streamline and optimize the clinical management of heart failure. Such technologies can take the form of mobile applications or wearable devices that may provide both patients and providers with valuable real-time information about patient status and cardiovascular health, provide automated patient-tailored coaching and motivational tools, or a mix of both. Integration of these technologies into healthcare systems may allow for genuine engagement of the patient in their own care and management of their disease and/or enhance clinical decision making.

Discovery phase: During the Discovery phase, we will conduct 1-hour focus groups at school sites with parents (N=8) and school mental health providers (N=4), who are considered major stakeholders and potential users of the dHealth tool. The purpose of these groups is to obtain feedback and guidance on features and procedures in order to maximize the usability and feasibility of the dHealth tool. This design includes participants who have completed a parenting skills treatment (CLS) and thus would be better informed to comment on needs for the augmented treatment. Stakeholders will be queried about their preferences regarding the application layout, tools, content, and features (e.g., reminders, badges). Recorded focus group sessions will be transcribed and coded for themes related to usability and feasibility.
Design and Build phases: Feedback from the discovery phase will be incorporated into the design and build phases, during which time prototypes will be put through proof of concept testing with parents and school clinicians who had participated in the discovery phase. Qualitative data will be collected at 2 time points during the design and build phases. Quantitative data will be gathered using the System Usability Scale (SUS) for each component prototype (e.g., description of skill, video examples, interactive activities). A fully functioning application will be completed at the end of the build phase and ready for the test phase.
Test Phase: The test phase is a 2-month pilot open trial of the dHealth tool with parents. We will provide the dHealth tool to parents who participated in the prior phases (N=5) as well as a new sample of parents (N=12) who will test the tool with their children in conjunction with the parent's participation in BPT at their school (to test tool utility during the course of treatment). Parents will be advised to use the tool daily to record parenting strategy use and to access information/training as needed. Qualitative semi-structured interviews during and after the trial will assess reactions to the platform (usability, feasibility, acceptability) to inform refinements and identify barriers and facilitators relating to use. Primary outcomes focus on usage metrics with the tool (e.g., frequency of use, module and activity completion, time, repeat activity), reported daily parenting skills use on the tool, and measures of feasibility and acceptability. Application usage analytics will be collected by the mobile application, providing objective descriptives including how often and for how long individuals access the application and each component, as well as how users navigate through the application. This data will be analyzed for patterns associated with tool satisfaction ratings, feasibility, and acceptability ratings and reported skill utilization. Secondary outcomes of parent knowledge, motivation and confidence in using EBT skills; parenting practices, ADHD symptoms and functional outcomes will be assessed before and after tool usage.

Despite evidence suggesting that behavioral interventions are efficacious, 41-60% of adolescents receiving behavioral treatment show little to no improvement and skills are rarely generalized beyond treatment sessions. Lack of adolescent motivation and engagement, between-session skills use, reward saliency, and family involvement are key contributors to these limited effects.

This is a single-group experimental 10-week trial of comparing the time consumed for measuring health indicators by using the new all-in-one health monitoring device and using the traditional devices, using days as the analysis unit (i.e. comparing the time consumed in two measurements on same days). Before the trial, there will be a 2-week period of device piloting and calibration, so all residents will be measured by the new device for 12 weeks. Views and comments from the operation staff on the usage of the device will also be collected.

Subjects

Care staff and residents in Haven of Hope Woo Ping Care & Attention Home & Haven of Hope Nursing Home will be recruited for the main analysis. If residents are competent in giving consent, both residents and their guarantor, who are responsible for making decisions and signing documents for the residents, will be approached for consent. In cases residents are not competent in giving consents, only their guarantor will be approached for consent.

Procedures

System Installation

The system installation includes the set up of Bluetooth connection between the monitoring device and mobile device, network connection of mobile device, set up of mobile app for system dashboard monitoring, data retrieval and printing out. The service unit and the product supplier shall discuss the installation plan.

Operation protocol preparation

A protocol including the dashboard control and related operations will be prepared for the staff.

Pilot run and calibration

The service unit will invite 3-4 eligible residents to participate in the pilot run. During a routine health monitoring session, 1-2 care staff will use the new device to carry out the measurement, and document any issues that influence the operation. The operation protocol will be revised as necessary.

At the same time, the care staff would conduct artificial intelligence (AI) calibration of the all-in-one health monitoring device with the residents. AI calibration involves using a specific wristband to measure the blood pressure of every resident, so that the app of the device can learn and calibrate the measure for every resident. The time spent and problems encountered during calibration will be documented.

Staff training

A few identical training sessions will be delivered to all care staff which will cover test rationale and instructions of using the monitoring device and the dashboard. The training will be recorded for the staff to re-watch it.

Participants' selection

All residents and care staff who operate daily health monitoring on the selected floors/wards in the residential homes will be invited. Residents' height, age and other basic vital health data will be used for calibration of the all-in-one health monitoring device. No other personal information will be recorded. Before the test, the recruitment staff will introduce the study to these participants and their family caregivers.

Implementation

On each day, the care staff will carry out health monitoring (temperature, blood pressure, and SpO2) with traditional devices (i.e. thermometer and blood pressure meter) and the existing workflow protocol on the participating floor, and the data transfer with a tablet manually. Specifically, the care staff need to go out from the nursing station to visit all the residents' rooms for several rounds and carry out the measurements. After each measurement, they immediately input the data in the tablet. On top of that, they (preferably the same staff or same professional level) will go out in separate rounds and use the new monitoring device to carry out the health monitoring again on the participating floor. The staff will need to login each user's account with the smartphone application before each measurement, and log out after each measurement. Each measurement using the new device takes 30 - 60 seconds. As the data integration has been completed, so that no manual data transfer is needed. After each round of health monitoring by the new device or the traditional devices, the staff will need to fill in log sheets designed by the University of Hong Kong (HKU) to document the time consumed for the entire process. HKU will also monitor the quality of how log sheets are filled together with the investigators of Haven of Hope Christian Service (HOHCS). Towards the end of the testing period, the vital signs collected by traditional devices will be passed to HKU research team for comparing the measurements taken by traditional devices and Dyno50. To ensure anonymity, only the numeric identifiers will be included in the dataset for data analysis. The Dyno50 system will remain a closed system and the abovementioned data required for this study will be provided by the two homes upon consent of the residents and guarantors.

In the qualitative sub-study, the unit IC or his/her designated staff in each of the homes will select by convenience at least 2 residents, 2 staff who operate daily health monitoring, and 1 staff who are responsible for the supervision of the health monitoring procedure for the qualitative interview. Also, 0 - 2 caregivers will be interviewed depending on the availability of caregivers who witnessed the daily operation of the all-in-one health monitoring device, as advised by the participating staff. HKU senior research assistant will be responsible for conducting the interviews. Each semi-structured interviews will take around 30 minutes.

Blinding

Participants and group moderators cannot and will not be blinded to the intervention.

Sample size determination

The sample size is estimated by the current number of residents in the two test sites. In the Woo Ping Care & Attention Home, 24 residents and 5 care staff will be included in this study. In the Haven of Hope Nursing Home, 40 residents and 6 care staff will be included.

Data analyses

In the main trial, paired sample t-test will be used to examine the difference in daily operation time between using the new monitoring device and the traditional devices for the 10-week main trial, adjusting for the number of residents measured. Moreover, paired sample t-test will be used to examine the difference in daily operation time between using the new monitoring device and the traditional devices for the 2-week pilot run and calibration and 10-week main trial, adjusting for the number of residents measured.

This is a single-group 4-week trial of using the remote health monitoring system. All care staff who manage the system will complete a very brief survey (1-minute) after each work shift for 2 weeks. Detection of abnormal vital signs will be recorded by the system. Hospital admission and further medical assistance due to the adoption of the system will be documented by the care team. The care staff will be interviewed about their perceived benefits and acceptability of the system.

Subjects

Care staff in Haven of Hope Woo Ping Care & Attention Home and Haven of Hope Nursing Home who are responsible to set up and operate real-time remote health monitoring system will be recruited. They also need to be able to read and understand Chinese.

Procedures

Implementation

The remote monitoring system will record the temperature, pulse and SpO2 of the residents wearing the equipment every minute. When the staff find abnormal vital signs, they will provide further medical assistance. After every shift during the trial period for 2 weeks, they will fill in a 1-minute survey.

Data collection

The remote monitoring system will remotely and real-time record the temperature, pulse and SpO2 of the residents wearing the sensor. The sensor is like a ring that wraps a finger. When the staff are notified of any abnormal vital signs by the system via screen display and notification sound, they will deliver further medical assistance. Hospital admission and further medical assistance due to the adoption of the system will be documented by the care team under pre-existing practice. After every shift during the trial period for 2 weeks, the staff will fill in a 1-minute survey about their operation and perceived efficiency of the system, such as facilitating more frequent monitoring of particular residents' vital signs, the provision of further medical assistance, perceived time saving in monitoring vital signs, and acceptability of the system. They could record their experience of using the system in a messaging mobile phone app in audio format. If they fill in the survey for fewer than 10 times during the 2 weeks, they would be invited to continue to fill in the survey after work shift after the 2 weeks until they fill in it for at least 10 times. Meanwhile, as a staff may complete more than 1 shift per day, they would not be invited to fill in the survey after having completed it for 12 items. All data collected that is related to residents is not identifiable.

There are two parts of the qualitative sub-study. When the system is set up, the unit in-charge and care staff responsible to set up the system from each participating unit will be interviewed by research assistant(s). Themes of qualitative questions include: (1) barriers and difficulties in the set-up of the system; and (2) the concerns in choosing wireless or cable connection for the monitoring device. Meanwhile, when the main trial ends, a total of 8-10 care staff from all participating units responsible to operate the system will be interviewed about their perceived benefits and acceptability of the system. Themes of qualitative questions include: (1) Acceptance of using the remote health monitoring system (including ease of operation, care staff's confidence and convenience in using the system); (2) Benefits of using the remote health monitoring system (including usefulness of the innovation, impacts on quality of care); (3) Concerns in using the remote health monitoring system (including if any residents stop using the sensor and the reason behind); and (4) Overall perception of using the remote health monitoring system. For both parts of the qualitative sub-study, an interview guide with open-ended and iterative questions will be used to probe for more experiences from the interviewees. Each interview will be conducted by a trained research assistant and will last about 15 - 30 minutes.

Blinding

Blinding is not applicable in this single group study.

Sample size determination

The sample size is estimated by the number and availability of the staff in the participating units. It is estimated that a total of 10-12 staff will be recruited.

Data analyses

The proportion of all the responses in the staff survey will be calculated. The number of abnormal vital signs, hospital admission and further medical assistance due to the adoption of the system will be counted.

The qualitative interview content will be transcribed verbatim in Chinese for further analysis.

A large percentage of stroke survivors, up to 70%, experience gait dysfunction, which can lead to reduced activity levels, limited community participation, and contribute to an increased risk of falls. Effective interventions to treat gait dysfunction are essential to reduce disability for these individuals.

The iStride™ gait device, initially designed to mimic the symmetry-improving mechanism of a split-belt treadmill, was developed to treat asymmetric gait impairments in stroke survivors. Unlike many currently available gait treatment devices, the iStride™ device is portable, therefore allowing gait treatment to occur overground and from the home environment. Training in natural environments is believed to enhance the transfer of learning as well as enable long-term training. Previously published studies with the iStride™ device demonstrate its ability to beneficially improve functional gait parameters, gait speed, and reduce fall risk in both clinical and home settings.

To monitor improvement in gait function, the device is paired with patented iStride sensors™. The combined system, the Moterum iStride Solution™, is currently being used by stroke survivors in the home environment. In the current delivery model, users are provided instruction and training from physical therapists in clinical settings before using the device in their home environment under the supervision of a Moterum staff member. User feedback has led to the exploration of novel methods to deliver device treatment remotely. [Additionally, the need for remote treatment has increased in urgency with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing guidelines.]

In this study, treatment with the iStride™ will be adapted to remote delivery using a telemedicine platform, the Moterum Digital Platform. A screening process will be implemented to guide participant selection and identify individuals likely to be successful with remote treatment delivery using the telemedicine modality. This process consists of an initial eligibility criteria review followed by a physical therapist video review of participant walking patterns.

Once enrolled in the clinical trial, participants will receive study-related equipment including the iStride™ device, Moterum iStride Hub and Sensors™, and a pre-measured strap for gait testing. They will be instructed in the download of the Moterum Digital Platform which will serve as the telemedicine modality for subsequent communication. Participants and their caregivers will be provided with instructional videos as well as therapist training on study procedures using video calls through the telemedicine platform. Instruction will include telemedicine portal navigation, iStride™ fitting (donning/doffing), mobility and walking guidelines with iStride™ device, assessment performance, environmental considerations, safety precautions, and caregiver guidelines and responsibilities.

Changes to gait patterns will be assessed using specialized gait sensors and functional outcome measures before, during, and after the treatment. Caregivers will be trained in the performance of these outcome measures which can be overseen by physical therapists through video conferencing.

Feasibility, compliance, and safety of the delivery method will be investigated throughout the trial using prompted questions within the Moterum Digital Platform and integrated forms to be completed by the participant and/or caregiver.
