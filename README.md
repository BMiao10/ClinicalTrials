## Characterization of digital therapeutic clinical trials using natural language processing

Digital therapeutics (DTx) are a novel class of FDA-regulated software that help patients prevent, manage, or treat disease. With a rapidly increasing number of approved DTx and DTx clinical trials, research is accelerating to add clinical evidence for these software-based therapeutics. Here, we take advantage of modern natural language processing methods to characterize registered DTx clinical trials and provide insights into the clinical development landscape for these novel therapeutics.
