## Characterization of digital therapeutic clinical trials using natural language processing

Digital therapeutics (DTx) are a novel class of FDA-regulated software that help patients prevent, manage, or treat disease. With a rapidly increasing number of approved DTx and DTx clinical trials, research is accelerating to add clinical evidence for these software-based therapeutics. Here, we take advantage of modern natural language processing methods to characterize registered DTx clinical trials and provide insights into the clinical development landscape for these novel therapeutics.

Due to size limitationas, the dashboard currently uses the "en_core_sci_sm" from [SciSpacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/). Other SciSpacy models can be used if run locally.
